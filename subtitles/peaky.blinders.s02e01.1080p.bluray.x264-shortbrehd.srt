1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,889
I'll be in London one week, at this address.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,447
Finish your business here and join me.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,090
<i>"Dear Grace...</i>

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,726
<i>"Before the war, when I had an important decision to make,</i>

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,004
<i>"I used to flip a coin.</i>

6
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,291
...and give him peace. Amen.

7
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,690
Amen.

8
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,167
I promised my friend Freddie Thorne

9
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,642
that I'd say a few words over his grave

10
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,404
if he should pass before me.

11
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,605
I made this promise before he became me brother-in-law.

12
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,682
When we were in France, fighting for the King.

13
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,886
Amen.

14
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,249
And in the end it wasn't war that took Freddie.

15
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,005
--Pestilence took him.

16
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,442
Come here.

17
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,282
But Freddie passed on his soul and his spirit to a new generation

18
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,131
- before he was cruelly taken.

19
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,008
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

20
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,126
- you might come back to Birmingham.

21
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,971
God, do you know how funny it is

22
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,566
that you've got chauffeurs in uniform now?

23
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,882
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

24
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,004
Do you know how unfair it is

25
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,209
that you've got four Bugattis when half the country's starving?

26
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,603
So now they've made you ashamed of us, eh?

27
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,883
Sometimes when I think how I used to be, it makes me embarrassed.

28
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,450
Karl's with his cousins.

29
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,326
I caught 'em trying to pinch flowers off a grave.

30
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,681
Ada.

31
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,965
Are you coming home?

32
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,645
I'm going home.

33
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,525
It's all right, Poll. We make Ada embarrassed.

34
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,284
That's not what I said.

35
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,722
There's another reason we want you home.

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,203
We're planning an expansion.

37
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,203
- I'm taking premises in London...

38
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,282
Tommy, it's a funeral, business can wait.

39
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,728
Polly, if Ada was weeping then I'd stop.

40
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,165
But she's not.

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,482
The expansion means it's going to be dangerous

42
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,324
to be a Shelby in London for a while.

43
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,881
Yeah.

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,322
Well, I'm not a Shelby any more.

45
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,362
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,446
I'm free.

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,809
I've got to get Karl home.

48
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,808
--I told you.

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,731
Let me do it.

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,371
It's all right.

51
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,610
I'll have some men watch her house till the danger passes.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,968
"Till the danger passes"?

53
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,165
That'll be the bloody day.

54
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,091
Go on, move away, go on.

55
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,331
It happened at, uh, exactly 7 a.m.

56
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,366
Nobody saw anything. Our patrols were not in the area.

57
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,968
Mr Shelby, have you got any idea who might've done it?

58
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,809
I'd say it was something to do with the gas.

59
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,844
It's just been fitted.

60
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,366
Er, madam, the structure's not yet declared safe.

61
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,371
--Madam!

62
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,963
This is all over the place.

63
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
Confetti.

64
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
You can go.

65
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,127
Right.

66
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,321
Who?

67
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,290
Who did this to us?

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,241
Whiskey. Irish.

69
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,167
I heard there was a bit of a bang in your part of town.

70
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,243
Gas and electric don't mix.

71
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,364
Who'd have thought they would, eh?

72
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,921
How's business otherwise, Mr Shelby?

73
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,605
You know something?

74
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,402
In these times of hunger and hardship,

75
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,369
business is surprisingly good.

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Which one of you is the Peaky Blinder devil?

77
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,085
Gentlemen.

78
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,809
Finn! Get in here.

79
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,201
Finn! Hold the phone. Come here.

80
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,049
- Take the odds. -Yeah, sure.

81
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,800
Polly.

82
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,364
Did he say who did it?

83
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,363
He's gone to the Black Lion.

84
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,526
On his own?

85
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,367
Tommy does everything on his own.

86
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,080
- Should I go to the Black Lion? -What?

87
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,640
- Should I go there and see him? -No.

88
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,369
Where the fuck is Arthur?

89
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,171
Protecting the Garrison's whisky from the police.

90
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,489
For fuck's sake!

91
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,851
Polly, it feels a little bit to me like things are getting out of hand.

92
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,405
So get 'em in hand.

93
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,362
Do you know what Ada said to me this morning?

94
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,127
She said we all look like we work in a factory under the ground.

95
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,448
She said we look like ghosts.

96
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,846
She'll be back.

97
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,761
When?

98
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,731
When she needs us.

99
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,410
And anyway, who the fuck would blow up our pub?

100
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,171
- Six. -Six what?

101
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,601
Six questions since you walked through the door.

102
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,243
Soon you're going to have to start being the man with the answers.

103
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,367
Why?

104
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,446
Seven.

105
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,523
Because when London happens, you'll have to hold up your end

106
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,403
or we'll find somebody else who can.

107
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,686
--Thomas Shelby.

108
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,245
You blew up my pub.

109
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,081
Anger defeats fear, good.

110
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,770
You blew up my pub.

111
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,240
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

112
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,410
A reputation for not being scared of anything.

113
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,969
In all the world, violent men are the easiest to deal with.

114
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,564
So tell me, which brand of rebel are you, eh?

115
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,569
I read somewhere that you Paddies

116
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,642
started fighting amongst yourselves, now.

117
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,529
The King offers you a peace treaty and you start a war about it.

118
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,651
That's funny, don't you think?

119
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,969
A war about peace.

120
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,926
So are you for the treaty or against the treaty?

121
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,162
Forgive me, I get confused.

122
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,762
You are one decision away from death, Mr Shelby.

123
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,688
So stop fucking smiling.

124
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,128
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

125
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,728
You have a son at the Cherrywood Road School in Harborne.

126
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,883
He has irons on his legs, his name is Sean,

127
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,760
he comes last in every race, poor boy.

128
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,322
Poor boy if the race was important.

129
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,289
Do you know what I mean, Irene O'Donnell?

130
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,328
There are other ways of carrying out this mission.

131
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,688
Please allow me to put a bullet in this scum tinker's head.

132
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,681
No.

133
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,327
He researches his enemies,

134
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,529
that's why he's been chosen.

135
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,651
I am chosen?

136
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,281
I'm chosen.

137
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,203
Can the chosen one smoke?

138
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,925
A vacancy has appeared and you're going to fill it.

139
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,691
Chosen by whom?

140
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,328
By an informed consensus.

141
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,685
I have things to do.

142
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,647
So perhaps you could tell the chosen one

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,082
what he's been chosen for.

144
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,683
From now on, Mr Shelby,

145
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,324
you shut your fucking gypsy mouth and listen to your instructions.

146
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,610
Fuck!

147
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,686
I need the area round the co-operative stables

148
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,889
clear of coppers between midnight and 4:00 tonight.

149
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,249
Right. Could I ask why?

150
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,644
Well, whatever it is you're going to do, don't start any fires.

151
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,087
The firemen go out on strike at midnight.

152
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,808
That's all. You can go.

153
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,289
I've got some information you might be interested in.

154
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
No charge.

155
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,051
There's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.

156
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,442
He's, uh, just passing through, he says.

157
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,606
Very grand these days.

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,251
He's head of some secret department,

159
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,251
the Irish Desk.

160
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,770
So I doubt he'll be bothering with the likes of us, eh?

161
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,404
I'll say good night, Tom.

162
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,165
I demand to speak to a representative!

163
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,650
A representative of His Majesty the King!

164
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,322
Father! Father!

165
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,449
It was the Ulsterman, the man with the wolf head!

166
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,045
Get the fuck off me!

167
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,964
You must reconcile yourself with the fate that awaits.

168
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,362
I demand to speak to a representative of His Majesty the King!

169
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,726
Make your peace with God.

170
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,849
A representative of His Majesty the King!

171
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,490
- Father. -Come on.

172
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,528
Now, wait! Where are you going?

173
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,405
Does someone here have business with the King?

174
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,605
Major Campbell.

175
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,967
--About time.

176
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,569
I am a very busy man, Governor.

177
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,125
In seven and a half minutes,

178
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,885
the man in that cell is due to be hanged for murder.

179
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,810
The murder of an Irish activist in Whitechapel.

180
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,565
Does the case ring any bells, Major Campbell?

181
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,126
No, Governor,

182
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,165
I hear no bells.

183
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,485
Since yesterday morning,

184
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,562
he's been claiming that the murder was ordered

185
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,722
by the British Secret Intelligence Service.

186
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,804
It's a little late to be coming up with nonsense like that,

187
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,086
don't you think?

188
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,003
He was told if he kept his mouth shut

189
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,003
there would be a last-minute pardon,

190
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,362
which has not materialised.

191
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,404
Forgive me, Governor,

192
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,726
but what business is this of mine?

193
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,005
He says the man who hired him

194
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,526
was an Intelligence Service Chief of Staff,

195
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,891
an Ulsterman.

196
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,926
Carries a cane with a wolf-head handle,

197
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,002
a bullet wound in his right leg.

198
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,921
No.

199
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,162
Still no bells. Governor,

200
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,089
you have a very clear remit.

201
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,246
Part of that remit is to oversee the smooth completion

202
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,649
of executions sanctioned by the Crown.

203
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,688
And in the next four minutes it is your duty to escort that man

204
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,969
to the gates of hell.

205
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,006
Is that clear?

206
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,402
And if you should ever have the desire

207
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,006
to discuss this matter with anyone else

208
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,046
I know where you live.

209
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,767
Arthur, Tommy's called a family meeting.

210
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,447
Arthur!

211
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,841
He just beat the shit out of an apprentice.

212
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,400
I had to take half the kid away in buckets.

213
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,846
Arthur.

214
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,165
2,000.

215
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,491
Come on.

216
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,491
Sit down, Finn.

217
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,204
- Where the bloody hell is Tommy? -He's on his way.

218
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,246
All right then, while we're waiting patiently...

219
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,882
Whisky.

220
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,727
Left over from the explosion.

221
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,170
It's good stuff, as well.

222
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
Right.

223
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,165
Before Tommy gets here,

224
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,168
I think there's a few things we need to get straight

225
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,651
between the rest of us.

226
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,846
You think?

227
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,206
Yeah.

228
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,323
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

229
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,930
When did we all take a vote on this expansion south?

230
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,408
You have anything to say,

231
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,290
you wait for Thomas.

232
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,691
Polly's fucking right.

233
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,330
I see all the books.

234
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,250
Legal and off track.

235
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,409
Sort of stuff you don't see.

236
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,885
And in the past year

237
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,490
the Shelby Company Limited

238
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,849
has been making £150

239
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,006
a day.

240
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,883
Right? A fucking day!

241
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,405
Sometimes more.

242
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,729
So what I want to know

243
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,249
is why are we changing things?

244
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,046
Polly, look what's happened already.

245
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,043
We haven't even set foot in London yet

246
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,964
and they've already blown up our fucking pub.

247
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,407
- Who said anything about cockneys? -Who else?

248
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,209
Do you know who did it, do you?

249
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,927
- No, she doesn't know who did it.

250
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,647
I'm told only family are allowed to speak.

251
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,969
Everyone's allowed to speak.

252
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,049
On your feet, Esme, let's hear what you have to say.

253
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,044
I speak for our household.

254
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,886
- So... -john, this company is

255
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,282
a modern enterprise and believes in equal rights for women.

256
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,805
On your feet, Esme.

257
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,171
I'm not a blood member of this family

258
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,127
but perhaps, indeed, because I'm not a member

259
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,362
I can see things in a different light.

260
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,165
So I'll get to my point.

261
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,970
That would be nice.

262
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,326
As my husband said,

263
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,131
Shelby Company Limited is now very successful.

264
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,089
--But London...

265
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,011
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush and Portobello.

266
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,326
It's more like wars between armies down there.

267
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,765
And the coppers fight side-by-side with them.

268
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,922
And there are foreigners of every description

269
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,327
and the use of bombs is the least of it.

270
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,450
I have a child,

271
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,321
blessed with the Shelby family good looks.

272
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,802
I want John to see him grow up.

273
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,040
I want us to someday live somewhere with fresh air and trees

274
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,209
and keep chickens or something.

275
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,366
But London is just smoke and trouble, Thomas.

276
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,041
Thomas?

277
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,205
That's all I have to say.

278
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,530
That was a lot of words, a lot of words.

279
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,488
Wash them down with a nice drink.

280
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,491
Thank you, Esme.

281
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,130
Firstly, the bang in the pub had nothing to do with London.

282
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,486
Understood?

283
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,722
The bang is something I'm dealing with on my own.

284
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,691
Secondly, we've nothing to fear from the proposed business expansion

285
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,569
so long as we stick together.

286
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,086
And after the first few weeks,

287
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,401
nine tenths of what we do in London will be legal.

288
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,522
The other tenth is in good hands. Isn't that right, Arthur?

289
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,966
That's right.

290
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,201
Now, some of you in this room have expressed your reservations.

291
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,486
Fair enough.

292
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,929
Any of you who want no part in the future of this company,

293
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,571
walk out the door...

294
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,051
Right now.

295
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,404
Go raise your chickens.

296
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,682
For those of you with ambition

297
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,642
the expansion process begins tomorrow.

298
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,925
Tomorrow?

299
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,085
I'm company treasurer, you should speak to me first.

300
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,123
It's Newmarket tomorrow, third busiest day of the year.

301
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,770
We have 18 staff.

302
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,161
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

303
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,402
Oh, I changed the combination.

304
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,685
--So what's going on, Thomas?

305
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,648
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

306
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,648
Give me the combination, Polly.

307
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,084
Polly, give me the combination.

308
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,041
What happened to the pub is Irish business.

309
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,488
We're in a situation where, for everyone's safety,

310
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,450
it's best if some things remain undisclosed.

311
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,651
So why tomorrow?

312
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,682
Like you say, tomorrow's Newmarket.

313
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,922
All the London bosses will be at the races.

314
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,282
What say you just roll up and take the city?

315
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,002
No, we take the opportunity to show our hand.

316
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,808
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs

317
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,803
have been at war in London for six months.

318
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,006
It's not our war.

319
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,401
The Jews have been having the worst of it. They need allies.

320
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,847
- Yeah, but we don't. -We need a foothold

321
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,002
at the southern end of the Grand Union.

322
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,242
The Jews control Camden Town.

323
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,890
Your mother said,

324
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,408
"It's his cleverness that'll kill him."

325
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,209
No-one gets killed, Polly.

326
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,162
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet and we leave our message.

327
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,449
If Alfie Solomon and his Camden boys come to us,

328
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,921
we'll negotiate the use of a secure bonded warehouse

329
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,731
and then our legal activities in London can begin.

330
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,885
Now please, open the fucking safe.

331
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,488
Do you know, it was a fine speech you made in there,

332
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,682
about this company believing in equal rights for women.

333
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,609
But when it comes to it,

334
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,802
you don't listen to a word we say.

335
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,004
Maybe you don't trust us.

336
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,604
She was one woman, Thomas.

337
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,841
Well, maybe it's time you forgot about her.

338
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,410
Forgot about who?

339
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,966
You and the boys, go and get yourselves killed.

340
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,443
Are you going to London now?

341
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,408
No, there's something I have to do first.

342
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,931
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

343
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,244
I got it out of a catalogue.

344
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,286
I'm doing a correspondence course.

345
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,249
I'm learning to do it with my eyes shut.

346
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,970
It's a test you have to do.

347
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,602
Will you come back before you go?

348
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,406
No.

349
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,324
I wish, just once, you wouldn't pay me,

350
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,689
as if we were ordinary people.

351
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,161
Yeah.

352
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,525
Let's begin.

353
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,810
Hands on the table.

354
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,721
Tonight we have two new pilgrims joining us.

355
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,962
So, let's welcome them.

356
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,805
Starting with you.

357
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,727
Who is it that you're seeking to reach?

358
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,005
My husband.

359
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,770
He was taken six months ago by the influenza.

360
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,451
I tried to reach him through Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

361
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,364
but she kept getting his middle name wrong.

362
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,530
Don't talk about Mrs Breach in this house.

363
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,651
She's an unsanctified charlatan.

364
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,840
And you?

365
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,730
Who do you seek?

366
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,728
Well, truth...

367
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,770
Sorry, truth is, I'm not even sure she's dead.

368
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,842
So I came here to find out.

369
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,800
Er...

370
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,002
You see, my son and my daughter

371
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,005
were taken from me when they were very small.

372
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,044
Taken by the parish authorities

373
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,043
and I never knew what happened to them.

374
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,124
But lately...

375
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,490
I've had a feeling.

376
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,005
Like, a feeling...

377
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,043
I can't put it into words.

378
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,206
And I keep having a dream.

379
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,410
I see a pretty girl,

380
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,130
about 18-yea rs-old.

381
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,446
She's standing across the street

382
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,165
and she tells me she's passed over.

383
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,805
Now, my daughter would have been 18 this year.

384
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,841
On May 15th.

385
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,171
And this girl has dark eyes like mine.

386
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,486
And she shouts and shouts.

387
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,210
And she tells me she wants to talk to me

388
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,210
because I'm her mother.

389
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,925
Now, I don't even know what name they gave her

390
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,368
after they stole her from me.

391
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,967
But if she does want to say goodbye,

392
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,923
I thought this would be the place.

393
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,962
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

394
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,120
You're gypsy?

395
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,130
The part of me that dreams is gypsy.

396
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,082
My maiden name is Shelby.

397
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,886
So,

398
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,728
perhaps you could do me first.

399
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,685
No!

400
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,685
No!

401
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,930
No!

402
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,244
No...

403
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,885
Eamonn Duggan?

404
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,449
All right, Tommy's here.

405
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,330
Hang on!

406
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,520
John!

407
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,931
I'm coming!

408
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,005
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

409
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,809
10 if I'm still sober.

410
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,243
I got it from the doctor.

411
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,522
Keeps me nice and calm.

412
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,643
Same thing they gave us in the trenches

413
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,484
to stop us fucking wanking.

414
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,164
Polly said it's good for me temper.

415
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,208
- It slows me down, Tom. -Arthur,

416
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,086
there are some things Polly doesn't understand.

417
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,006
- I need you fast. Not slow, eh?

418
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,804
She wouldn't let go of my fucking leg.

419
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,484
I bet that's not all she wouldn't let go of.

420
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,770
Right. You know she's against this, Tom. She's got opinions.

421
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,524
Nothing wrong with opinions, john. Come on.

422
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,284
- Get in the fucking car! -Shut up.

423
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,611
Right!

424
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,604
The Peaky Blinders are going on fucking holiday!

425
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,967
Sit down, you mad bastard.

426
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,961
You're against this the same as me, aren't you?

427
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,966
Look out for anyone putting big money on Divine Star

428
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,008
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

429
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,205
She's one of ours.

430
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,244
Anything over a pound, tell me.

431
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,927
Polly,

432
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,447
I don't wish to pry into your business,

433
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,770
but you should know something.

434
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,048
That woman is a trickster.

435
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,725
What woman?

436
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,886
Her sister was in the washhouse early,

437
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,006
boasting there'd been a Shelby at the table.

438
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,166
What woman?

439
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,969
Gypsies talk to each other.

440
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,729
What woman?

441
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,851
You went to see Mrs Price in the Patch last night.

442
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,565
I'm sorry...

443
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,885
So what do you know?

444
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,884
I know they push the glass.

445
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,203
The man, it's her cousin. He pushes the glass.

446
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,441
It's a trick.

447
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,048
They tell you what you already believe.

448
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,924
She set up after the war because of all the widows.

449
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,122
Polly, I just thought you should know.

450
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,043
And in this fucking washhouse,

451
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,963
did they tell you why I went there?

452
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,888
You tell a soul in this family,

453
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,202
and I swear I will cut you.

454
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,324
I don't need a knife to stop me telling secrets given in confidence.

455
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,489
It is a matter of honour.

456
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,124
Look at this! Look.

457
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,845
- I love it.

458
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,441
Your Esme was right about one thing,

459
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,807
you can't beat the countryside.

460
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,567
You know, I think I want to live in the country one day

461
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,610
and keep chickens.

462
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,322
Yeah, we'll see you in London, Arthur.

463
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,480
- Oh, for fuck's sake! -Take this.

464
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,491
We need to bury him.

465
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,164
Who the fuck is that?

466
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,891
It's Irish business.

467
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,201
I thought it best if I deal with it on my own.

468
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,286
Come on, we did a thousand of these in France.

469
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,725
John, grab his head.

470
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,048
So, we're not really going to London?

471
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,290
Once we bury him,

472
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,484
then the holiday begins.

473
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,725
Much obliged.

474
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,327
It's a fucking freak show.

475
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,446
What the fuck is that racket?

476
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,807
This is what they call music these days, brother.

477
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,041
Music?

478
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,401
oi!

479
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,926
Oi! Put it away.

480
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,365
Fuck off!

481
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,487
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

482
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,570
It's all right, isn't it?

483
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,480
Irish whiskey, a bottle.

484
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,810
And hurry UP!

485
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,530
Fucking hell,

486
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,602
I recognise a few of these lads.

487
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,769
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

488
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,211
That's right, Arthur, it's Sabini's club.

489
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,722
Jesus Christ, everybody in here's a fucking face.

490
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,805
Just the lieutenants, john. No sign of the officers.

491
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,044
Right, let's line them up.

492
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,086
Holiday!

493
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,528
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

494
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,568
I'm afraid you're going to have to leave.

495
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,643
We just bought a fucking bottle.

496
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,088
Some of the men here recognise you from the racetracks in the north.

497
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,487
Yeah, we get that a lot.

498
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,609
They say you have no business coming south of the line

499
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,569
without prior agreement.

500
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,007
And what line would that be, my friend?

501
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,646
They say this is provocation.

502
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,443
Right, well, you tell them we're on holiday.

503
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,849
You're breaking the rules.

504
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,809
They say you are the Peaky Blinders...

505
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,531
Peaky scum!

506
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,690
Who the fuck's next?

507
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,451
Come here!

508
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,809
Put some ice on 'em!

509
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,291
Get out.

510
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,086
Yeah?

511
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,851
Yeah?

512
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,440
Are you going to use that?

513
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,480
Didn't think so.

514
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,402
We came here not to make enemies.

515
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,566
No.

516
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,571
We came here to make new friends!

517
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,167
Those of you who are last

518
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,802
will soon be first.

519
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,645
And those of you who are downtrodden will rise up.

520
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,806
Yup.

521
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,209
You know where to find us.

522
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,729
I think I've lost a tooth.

523
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,646
I'll have none left at this rate!

524
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,609
Some fucking holiday this is.

525
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,923
Yeah? You all right without your fucking medicine, Arthur?

526
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,480
- Here, this'll fix you. -Give me that!

527
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,847
- You, john boy, eh? How are you?

528
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,491
- Or should I ask your fucking wife? -Oh, give over!

529
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,085
No more talk of chickens, do you hear me?

530
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,844
--Fuck the chickens.

531
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,649
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

532
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,085
Let's paint the town, eh?

533
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,522
- Come.

534
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,686
- Oh, dear God! -Good Lord, I assumed

535
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,524
it was Betty with tea.

536
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,642
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary was not at the desk.

537
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,963
No, because she takes lunch, like normal people.

538
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,487
And you can turn around,

539
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,211
this lady is a professional life model.

540
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,884
She does this for a living.

541
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,051
I... I'm more than happy to come back later, sir.

542
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,124
No, no, no. Later on I'm in the House. just, erm,

543
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,486
keep your back turned, if you must.

544
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,925
Yes, sir.

545
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,888
I would guess you haven't been exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

546
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,288
Well, I... I... I play cards on occasion.

547
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,809
You're a stranger to cocaine and exotic dancing, too, I would imagine.

548
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,324
I find the more obvious vices the easiest to resist.

549
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,247
It's the sneaky little obscure ones that bring you to your knees, yes?

550
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,766
So what business is so urgent it trumps lunch?

551
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,048
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

552
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,566
has passed his first test with flying colours.

553
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,449
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

554
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,524
So I think we can begin to prepare him for...

555
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,851
The bigger task.

556
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,321
Expressions elude me, I think too much.

557
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,561
Sir?

558
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,804
I need your authority

559
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,690
to proceed with all urgency

560
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,522
in preparing the new man for the bigger task.

561
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,211
You're talking about your bookmaker.

562
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,687
Yes, sir.

563
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,048
You have a history with this man. Why did you choose him?

564
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,371
Well, to apply pressure on a man for this type of work

565
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,044
you have to know his weaknesses

566
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,727
and I know this man's weaknesses intimately.

567
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,007
And after "mission accomplished",

568
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,560
do we trust him to keep his mouth shut?

569
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,009
Absolutely not, sir.

570
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,761
So when he's served his purpose,

571
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,684
he will be consigned to history

572
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,967
in exactly the same way as his predecessor.

573
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,361
You mean at the end of a rope?

574
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,689
Well, the end of the rope has been this man's destiny

575
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,688
since the night he was born.

576
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,931
You're early.

577
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,884
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

578
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,801
What?

579
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,884
Shut your eyes. Go on, shut your eyes.

580
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,080
Good. Now, come with me.

581
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,685
No, shut your eyes!

582
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,525
--This way.

583
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,284
What are you doing, Tom?

584
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,408
You've got to sit down here. Right.

585
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,530
--Sit down. Now, okay...

586
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,804
- Type this. -Why?

587
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,325
Lizzie, type this.

588
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,002
"If wi..." Put your cigarette out.

589
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,088
Right. "If winter comes...

590
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,564
--"...then can spring be far behind?"

591
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,008
Why? Did you say spring?

592
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,923
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

593
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,966
Let's see.

594
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,563
That's a question. Where's the question mark?

595
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,971
Put in the question mark.

596
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,764
Now type this.

597
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,287
"Wanted, secretary for expanding business."

598
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,646
Slow down!

599
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,644
"Must be able to take dictation and touch type.

600
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,210
"Five days a week.

601
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,126
"Uh, eight pounds and four shillings a month.

602
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,441
"Must be able to start immediately."

603
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,086
Are you serious?

604
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,722
Things are starting to happen, Lizzie.

605
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,930
I need someone who can look the other way sometimes.

606
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,441
And you can stop the other work too, Lizzie.

607
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,241
All of it this time.

608
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,531
No exceptions.

609
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,724
Eight o'clock, Monday morning, the upstairs office.

610
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,881
Don't be late.

611
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,524
Newmarket was profitable.

612
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,687
Arthur told me how you left your message.

613
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,320
And when I asked him where his medicine was,

614
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,606
he said you poured it away.

615
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,160
All I poured away was opium and bromide.

616
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,162
Oh, that's how it works in London, isn't it?

617
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,891
Every boss has to have a mad dog at his side.

618
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,248
Yeah, somebody who can't be predicted, somebody mad in the head.

619
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,368
But Thomas Shelby uses his own brother.

620
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,489
- Stop fucking fighting me! -Somebody has to.

621
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,330
That arrived an hour ago.

622
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,006
There's no name on it but it comes from Camden Town.

623
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,251
I was going to burn it.

624
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,685
I should have.

625
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,963
Well done, Tommy, you've picked a side.

626
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,362
Now you're at war with Sabini.

627
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,446
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

628
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,171
No, the woman upstairs is looking after Karl.

629
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,969
She goes mad if I'm late!

630
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,568
- Ada Shelby? -No.

631
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,685
Your brother broke the rules.

632
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,046
I don't have a fucking brother.

633
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,600
Me and my friends here need a bit of female company.

634
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,284
- Let's go for a drive. -No!

635
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,323
- Hold her steady, boys. -Don't! Get off!

636
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,807
- Fucking hold him!

637
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,564
Tommy Shelby, I missed you at my club.

638
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,962
I was at the races.

639
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,771
Sabini.

640
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,685
Don't say my name.

641
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,170
Jesus!

642
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,766
Franco,

643
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,448
take my name out of his mouth.

644
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,244
While you're in there, do a bit of digging for gold.

645
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,526
Pay for the petrol.

646
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,169
You see how much I know about you?

647
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,843
I even know what's in your fucking mouth.

648
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,523
Look at me. Look at me!

649
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,720
Look at me.

650
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,203
You take up with the Jews.

651
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,760
Yeah, you think that's what London's all about.

652
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,241
You can just come down, pick a side.

653
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,448
You fucking clown!

654
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,968
Now your life is over.

655
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,531
My face is the last thing you'll ever see on earth.

656
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,285
Your mistake.

657
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,647
You remember that when you get to hell.

658
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,645
Finish him off.

659
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,926
--You! Get back here!

660
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:16,762
I suppose we should see if the bastard's still alive.
