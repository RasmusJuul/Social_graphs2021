== Relationships ==
===Thomas Shelby===
[[File:Tumblr pf1iybQsM61u58rmv 400.gif|thumb|250px|Thomas and Lizzie in [[Series 1]]]]
At first, Lizzie resents Thomas for ruining her potential marriage with John and for manipulating her into telling him about her prostitution work. In the [[Series 2|second series]], Thomas asks Lizzie to be a secretary of sorts for him, under the one condition that she no longer continues her prostitution work. At the Epsom Races, Thomas asks Lizzie to seduce a military officer as a distraction. Though Lizzie is clearly uncomfortable with the notion of reverting to her prostitution work, she does so anyway, but not before Thomas promises her he will return before it goes too far. The officer is seen forcing himself upon Lizzie to her dismay before Thomas can reach them, but upon doing so, he kills the officer.

Throughout the fourth series, Lizzie and Thomas continue to have a sexual relationship and Lizzie becomes pregnant and gives birth to Thomas' daughter, [[Ruby Shelby]].

In [[Series 5]], Lizzie and Thomas are married. Lizzie is raising [[Ruby Shelby|Ruby]] and [[Charles Shelby|Charles]] but her marriage with Thomas is strained as he is still hallucinating [[Grace Shelby|Grace]]’s ghost. Lizzie is tired of Thomas always being too busy with business for their family and debates divorcing him when she finds a lawyer in London who will represent her. She ultimately decides to stay with Thomas on the conditions that he does not "fuck another woman in their house" or a day after holding the hand of their children.

=== John Shelby===
[[File:12.gif|thumb|John comforting Lizzie at the Epsom Races]]
In [[Series 1]], Lizzie is engaged to become John's wife and helps look after his children. When his brother Thomas finds out and confronts her, Lizzie tells him that John is "a good man" and that she loves him. However, this still isn't enough to stop Thomas, who had been one of Lizzie's customers, from telling John about Lizzie's continued prostitution work.

Despite the fact that she didn't end up marrying John, Lizzie continues to be good friends with him. When she is emotional after her bad experience at the Epsom Derby, John comforts her but mistakenly assumes she was still working as a prostitute and had a bad experience with a client. Lizzie doesn't correct his mistake, instead reminding him of how much better of a man he is than Thomas, and that she thinks he should leave the Peaky Blinders gang before it potentially ruins him too. These honest words from Lizzie leave John speechless for a moment.

It is presumed Lizzie was upset after hearing the news of John's death, as her reaction was never shown.

=== Jeremiah Jesus===
Lizzie Shelby is good friends with Jeremiah Jesus, the street preacher, who is first seen sat next to her at [[The Garrison Pub]] during its reopening. Jeremiah also escorts Lizzie to the Epsom Derby to do a job for Thomas.

=== Arthur Shelby===

In [[Series 5]], Lizzie is close with Arthur's wife [[Linda Shelby|Linda]]. The two meet and discuss their futures with their husbands, but Lizzie advises Linda not to leave Arthur for another man as he would kill him.
