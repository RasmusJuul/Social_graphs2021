'''Chinn''' is a Chinese young prostitute attached to the brothel-dry cleaning den owned by [[Mr. Zhang]].  At some unknown point of time Chinn immigrated to England and learned English.  While she speaks a modest amount of English, she uses it to talk to her customers while "working," and appears to have gentle persona who takes care of her customers. She also presents herself in a shy manner. Perhaps playing a role that most older men like Campbell will seek out.   Chinn also appears to be a romantic. Preferring to take customers that have recently lost wives and sees her work as "helping" these men. Showing that she is new to her profession, as most prostitutes have a pessimist view on their work and of love. 

While Chinn's interaction with [[Inspector Campbell|Campbell]] started off gentle, when he gained dominance and took her rage out on her pretending she was Grace. He raped her, and at one point pushed her head down into the pillow. Which could've killed her.  When Campbell is finished, Chinn quickly slips from beneath him and dresses herself.  After he exclaims surprise at her busted lip, she tells him. "It's ok you are special, special customer." Showing that's she is not as na√Øve as she presents herself.  

Fully aware that prostitutes get hurt and raped by their customers countless times, and it's the inspector's status that will make this event swept under the rug. While Campbell tries to have her sit with him on the bed, she instead runs away while bleeding. [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] and the brothers see her, distressed in the back arguing with [[Mr. Zhang]] downstairs, while Mr. Zhang comforts her. It's her treatment, that prompts [[Mr. Zhang]] to tell Thomas Shelby that Inspector Campbell is upstairs. [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] and the [[Inspector Campbell|inspector]] converse in her bedroom.

It can be assumed that Inspector Campbell was banned from that brothel, as he visited it again.
