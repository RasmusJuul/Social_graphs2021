==Character History==
===Background===
May Carleton comes from a well-to-do family. She is well connected with everyone from the war-office to racing-board. Since her husband’s death, she has lived alone in her late husband’s mansion. Though she's a rich widow and a successful race-horse trainer, she is lonely and bored with her strait-laced life.

=== Series 2 · 1922===
May Carleton is at the horse auctions with her father, when Thomas Shelby and his gang arrive. Her interest is piqued by Thomas, and she bids on the race-horse he's trying to buy to gain his attention. Afterwards, she offers to train Thomas's new horse.

Thomas eventually does hire May to train his new horse, who he names Grace’s Secret.

Thomas invites himself over to May's mansion to get a progress report on his horse. She reveals that she has lived alone since her husband’s death.

Later, Thomas visits May to confess that he still loves [[Grace Burgess|Grace]] and that they should separate. But May tells him: 'You’ve told me about her like a gentleman – now kindly behave like a gangster for me again,' before adding: 'I will win you.'

At Epsom, Thomas bids a cryptic goodbye to May as she prepares his horse for the Derby, where the Peaky Blinders plan to hold up their rival [[Darby Sabini]]’s bookmakers and burn their licenses. May has influence with the Board and can make sure that all the applications for legal pitches from Sabini's men at the Derby will be denied and instead allocated to Thomas's bookies.

After the race, May and Grace both wait for Thomas to turn up in the bar and find them, but instead find each other. They have a exchange of words: May can ensure that the bookie’s licences go with the [[Peaky Blinders]], while Grace fires a parting shot about the horse’s name.
