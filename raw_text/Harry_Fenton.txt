==Character Biography==
===Series 1 Â· 1919===
Harry's involvement in Series 1 is somewhat minimal but influential. After witnessing [[Grace Burgess]]' singing, he agrees to hire her as a bartender at [[the Garrison]], his pub. After the Garrison becomes a popular hotspot for the [[Peaky Blinders]], Thomas Shelby purchases the pub from him, compensating him well. While he is not happy about the purchase, he understands that he does not have a choice, given the wealth and influence of the Peaky Blinders. He remains a bartender at the Garrison, covering Peaky business wherever possible.
