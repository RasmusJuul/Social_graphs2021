'''Mr. Zhang''' is the owner of a Chinese brothel-dry cleaning den. One of the prostitutes attached to the brothel is [[Chinn]]. [[Chinn]] was a prostitute, [[Inspector Campbell|Campbell]] raped in season 1, episode 6. 

It is implied by many including [[Inspector Campbell|Inspector Campbell,]] his brothel is often visited by police men. While the men are paying for the girls, their clothes are being washed and dried. 

His daughter [[Mei Zhang|Mei]] is a 'fortune telling girl' who supposedly put a spell on [[Thomas Shelby]]'s horse at the start of [[Episode 1.1]].  That same horse won races two times in a row, which helped kick off the [[Shelby Company Limited|Shelby]] business. But any blessing [[Mei Zhang|Mei]] put in place, faded on the third race which the horse lost.

Mr. Zhang's dry cleaning service is used by most of the men we see on screen including [[Thomas Shelby]], [[Darby Sabini|Saboni]], [[Billy Kimber]], [[Inspector Campbell|Chester Campbell]], and many more. As well any customer of the brothel.
