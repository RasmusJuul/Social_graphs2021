== Character History ==

=== SERIES 3 · 1924 ===
Angel is revealed to be the love interest of [[Lizzie Stark]].  The night before the wedding of [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] and [[Grace Shelby|Grace]], Angel’s restaurant is burnt down by the [[Peaky Blinders]] to prevent him from coming to the wedding with [[Lizzie Stark]]. Lizzie confronts [[Michael Gray|Michael]] and [[Arthur Shelby Jr.|Arthur]] about this.

Michael reveals that they checked Angel’s background, and that he has had five different names in the last six years, and has connections with enemies of the Peaky Blinders, making him an unsuitable partner for Lizzie.

When Angel's father goes to confront [[Arthur Shelby Jr.|Arthur]] and [[John Shelby|John]] about this, they threaten Angel's wellbeing. Vicente's threatening John's life causes John to go and beat up Angel, and to thrash then cut him over the eye with the razor blades on his cap. Angel is later seen in a poor state at a hospital, convulsing and yelling in pain.

In revenge, Angel's father hires a man to shoot [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] at the Shelby Charity Foundation Dinner. [[Grace Shelby|Grace]] is shot instead by mistake.

In further retaliation, not only is the hitman brutally beaten, likely to death, but the Shelbys later assassinated Angel in his hospital bed.
