Following Freddie's death from 'pestilence', Ada has moved to London. Her support for the Communist cause leads to a disapproval of the lifestyle of her family and this results in her self-imposed isolation from the Shelby clan. However, Thomas still pays her visits and looks out for her welfare. Ada accepts his concern but is still critical of his lifestyle.

=== Series 3 · 1924 ===
Ada's involvement in the Peaky Blinders somewhat increases throughout 1924. Being bored with her current work, she begins to ask more questions about Peaky business, including asking who the Russians were that attended Tommy's wedding.

Nearing the end of 1924, Ada's interests in the family business, [[Shelby Company Limited]] have grown to such an extent that she takes up place as ''"Head of Property and Acquisitions"'' in a US branch of the company — this marks the first moment since she appeared that she has taken an interest in the Shelby family business; whether this be the company or activities of the Peaky Blinders.

The Shelby family must find a way to put differences aside, work together, and take up arms and fight for survival.

=== Series 5 · 1929 ===
Ada's involvement in the Peaky Blinders and Shelby Company Limited during 1929 is somewhat minimal.

Ada's situation becomes increasingly difficult following the death of Younger, leaving her unborn child without a father. She admits to Tommy that she didn't love Ben, but he was a good man who did not know about their unborn child. She attends Shelby and Peaky meetings despite not taking a strong role within either. 

== Relationships ==

=== Freddie Thorne ===
[[File:Freddie Ada.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Freddie and Ada marry ]]
The relationship between Ada and Freddie grew during the events of series 1, where the two became involved in a secret relationship. As a known communist and an ex-friend of Tommy's, Freddie was keen to keep the relationship between the two a secret, fearing an out-lash from the Peaky Blinders — Thomas especially.

Following the birth of their child, [[Karl Thorne]], the two open up more about their relationship, and Thomas allows a truce during the night of their child's birth. The relationship becomes strained, however after Freddie is arrested. Believing that Tommy was behind the tip off, the relationship between Ada and Tommy suffers, before Freddie is rescued by Tommy to prove his innocence.

The relationship begins to prosper after Freddie is welcomed back into the society of Birmingham, particularly when he is welcomed by Tommy during his fight with [[Billy Kimber]] and the Birmingham Boys. The relationship is short lived, however as Freddie passes away due to pestilence at the beginning of 1922.

=== Thomas Shelby ===
Thomas is Ada's older brother and the relationship between the two is one of the strongest out of the two. He is at first unaware of the secret relationship between Ada and Freddie, however becomes very concerned when Polly reveals that Ada is pregnant, questioning who the father is. Figuring out that the father is Freddie, Tommy threatens him, not believing him to be enough for Ada. However Thomas understands the importance of love and allows a truce during the birth of their son, allowing Freddie to attend.

Tensions rise between the two when Freddie is arrested on a tip off to the police during the birth night. Ada firmly believes this to be Thomas' fault, however he rightfully denies revealing Freddie's location to the police. Wanting to prove himself to Ada, he authorizes the Peaky Blinders to break Freddie out of prison during his transit to a more secure facility; repairing the relationship between Ada and himself.

During series 4 she seems to be Tom's right arm in doing the legal part of his business by carrying out tasks given by him. In series 5, their relationship is shown to be stronger as she acts as his confidant and counselor on matters of the heart.

=== Aunt Polly ===
Polly is Ada's aunt and acts as a close maternal figure throughout her life, including during her relationship with Freddie. Polly becomes aware of the secret relationship and aids Ada in hiding it from her brothers, including when Ada becomes pregnant with Freddie's child. Polly urges the two to leave Birmingham behind, gifting them money from the [[Peaky Blinders]]; however Freddie refuses to take the money, much to Ada's dismay.

After the birth of Karl, Polly welcomes Ada and Karl into the Shelby family business and the Peaky Blinders as a whole, much to Ada's surprise and she known as a PORN star
