}}'''Jeremiah "Jimmy" Jesus''' is an Afro-Caribbean local street preacher and a long time member of the [[Peaky Blinders]]. He fought in the war alongside [[Thomas Shelby]], and has been a close ally ever since. He is the father of [[Isiah Jesus|Isaiah]].

==Character History==
=== Background ===

History before his involvement with the Peaky Blinders. He fought in the war alongside [[Thomas Shelby]], but vowed never to pick up a weapon again after the end of the war. It is unknown if he turned to god after the war or was somewhat religious beforehand.

=== Series 1 - 1919===
Jeremiah does not take much of an active involvement within the Peaky Blinders during their younger years — he provides mostly advice and religious support to the members. However, in ''[[Episode 1.6]]'' when the Peaky Blinders take on [[Billy Kimber]] and the Birmingham Boys directly, he is involved in the fight. While he promised never to pick up a gun again after the war, Tommy asks Jeremiah to pick up a weapon and defend Small Heath once again, to which he agrees.

=== Series 3 - 1924===
Similar to his earlier involvement with the Peaky Blinders, Jeremiah does not take much involvement, but does perform the marriage between [[Thomas Shelby]] and [[Grace Shelby]], and this is his only appearance in [[Series 3]].

=== Series 4 - 1925-1926 ===
While Jeremiah does not take much part in Peaky Blinder business during 1925 — 1926, he is mentioned at [[John Shelby]]'s funeral, where it is mentioned that he served with him during the war in France.
