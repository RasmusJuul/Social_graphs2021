Gina returns to Small Heath, Birmingham with Michael following the Wall St. Crash and the huge financial loss from Shelby Company Limited.

Upon arriving back in England Gina is then introduced to her new family through a fiery encounter between Michael and Polly and Arthur.

Due to her marriage with Michael, she is privy to Shelby family meetings and is present when Michael announces his idea to restructure the company and take her, and their unborn child, back to the US. She initially stands by while Tommy scoffs at Michael's proposal, before pressuring Michael to reveal to everyone that those in America no longer wish to deal with the Peaky Blinders. Tommy throws Michael's proposal into the fireplace before banishing them from the family, telling him and Gina to leave and never come back before warning Gina to not fuck with the Peaky Blinders. Arthur and Polly then leave with Arthur growling angrily at Michael telling him fuck the Americans before Polly slaps her son angrily across the face looking at him in anger and disgust before giving Gina a cold look knowing full well that she is the reason behind Michael's proposal before walking off. Gina then looks over at Michael and says they have to do it the other way hinting that she and Michael betrayed Tommy to Oswald Mosley about the assassination attempt on him to they will have to take over the company some other way likely involving her family.
