Isiah is one of the first friends that Michael makes when he becomes involved with the Peaky Blinders. The two become instant friends and, one night, decide to go drinking at a local pub, [[The Marquis of Lorne]]. When they arrive at the pub, one of the customers refuses to drink in the same pub as a black man. The man demands that Isiah leaves, however Isaiah refuses, remarking that the man should instead leave. Initially, the man does not know that Isiah is a Peaky Blinder, nor that he is in fact with [[Michael Gray]], and the two begin fighting with the men in the pub. The fight quickly comes to a halt, however, when the barman reveals that Michael is Polly Shelby's son — the men immediately stop the fight and apologise.
