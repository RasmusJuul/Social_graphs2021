'''Donal Henry''' was a spy who worked for the Irregulars against the pro-treaty Paddies. He regularly reported and information gathered from [[Chester Campbell|Inspector Campbell]]’s policemen and agents of the crown back to the anti-treaty Paddies. He loathed [[Thomas Shelby]] and had trouble holding his anger back during meetings

== Series 2 - 1922 ==
Along with [[Irene O’Donnell|Irene O'Donnel]], Henry meets with [[Thomas Shelby]] at a rival pub called '''The''' '''Black Lion, '''to blackmail him into carrying out an assassination. 

Donal sits to the left-side of Irene with a gun in front of him. When [[Irene O’Donnell|Irene]] jokes about Thomas's desire to uphold his reputation Donal sarcastically retorts, saying "a reputation for not being scared of anything". As [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] mocks the Paddise's fight over whether to accept or refuse the King's peace treaty, Donal rises from his chair, slowly picks up the gun, dragging it on the table and tells Thomas to stop smiling. When Thomas reveals that he knows Irene's identity, Donal points the revolver towards Thomas's head, asking Irene for permission to kill him. After she denies him the request, he reticently removes the gun.

During a meeting between [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] and [[Chester Campbell|Campbell]], Irene and Donal are also present. Thomas realises that the three of them are working together, which amuses him. Donal calls him an "arrogant bastard" and proposes for them to stop Thomas from mocking them for allying themselves with an agent of the crown. After [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] is presented with the target of his mission, Donal tells him that refusing to carry out the assassination means death.

When Thomas exits the room, refusing to finish the mission, he reveals to [[Chester Campbell|Campbell]] that Donal is a spy for the Irregulars against the pro-treaty Paddies, and he has been reporting every word back to them. Thomas makes it clear to Campbell that unless Donal dies with proof of his death sent to him, he’ll refuse to carry out the assassination.

== Death ==
Henry is assassinated sometime in 1922, presumably by men working for [[Chester Campbell|Major Campbell]]. His body is discovered in a pile of coal by an industrial worker. Proof of his death is sent to Thomas Shelby as part of his agreement to assassinate Henry Russell.
