==Character History==
===Background===
Aberama Gold is a Gypsy hit-man with a bad reputation as a savage. He has a son, Bonnie Gold, and three daughters, the oldest of whom is named Esmeralda. His wife is deceased, but Aberama describes Bonnie as having his father's strength and his mother's temper. His grandfather and Thomas’ camped together at some point but the relationship ended badly.

=== Series 4 · 1925-1926  ===
When Italian-American gangster Luca Changretta arrives in Birmingham to destroy the Shelby family as part of his vendetta, Thomas Shelby hires Aberama Gold and his crew as muscle. The Gold mob have a particularly bad and fearsome reputation even among criminals, and Johnny Dogs describes them as untrustworthy 'savages', 'heathens' who prey on their own community.

Nevertheless, Thomas hires them, sending an invitation for John Shelby's funeral to Aberama and using the funeral to lure out two local Italian criminals working for Changretta. Aberama and his son Bonnie kill the two assassins as they prepare to shoot Thomas, then brings them to Thomas on horseback and demands £1,000 as payment. As he passes Polly he tips his hat to her flirtatiously.

[[File:Ep4_2_Aberama_Gold.png|thumb|Aberama kills an Italian assassin.|250px]]Gold and his caravan are taken to [[Charlie Strong's Yard]], where Aberama provocatively demands ownership of the yard as payment for his support. Thomas instead offers to stake the yard on a coin toss, demanding sex with Aberama's daughter should Aberama lose. Aberama backs down, and Thomas warns him not to disrespect the Shelby's friends in future.

After Polly advises him that Gold wants something other than money, Thomas asks Aberama what he really wants. Gold admits that he wants Thomas to take on his son, Bonnie, to train as a professional boxer in return for his help.

To test the kid’s skills, Thomas finds former boxing champion [[Billy Mills]] in his factory and asks him to fight Bonnie Gold. During the fight, Aberama coaches his son from the ringside. Despite being much smaller than Mills, Bonnie easily defeats the former heavyweight and Thomas and Arthur Shelby agree to take him on, sending him to train with [[King Maine]] in preparation for promoting him professionally.

[[File:Ep4_4_Aberama_Gold.png|thumb|Aberama shoots a policeman after firing at Luca Changretta.|250px]]After Luca Changretta storms the hospital where [[Michael Gray]] is being treated, Thomas orders Aberama to kill Luca. Aberama and his men stop Luca's vehicle in the middle of nowhere and open fire, killing two of them and wounding a policeman, but Luca manages to escape. Thomas complains to Aberama for shooting the policeman and letting Luca escape, but Aberama says shooting the policeman was part of his strategy and brags that he has managed to kill more of the Italians than Tommy has.

[[File:Ep4_4_Polly_Aberama.png|thumb|250px|Aberama and [[Polly Shelby|Polly Gray]]|left]]After Polly doubles crosses Changretta, Aberama supports her, sending her son Michael Gray into hiding with the Gypsies.

Afterwards, Polly and Aberama picnic by a lake, taking a long way back to Small Heath. She tells him about her near-death experience and second sight, saying she sees his dead wife watching him. They flirt before Polly demands Gold's knife and warns him at knifepoint not to harm Michael. Aberama understands and they make out.

[[File:Ep4_6_Aberama_Bonnie_King.jpg|thumb|Aberama, Bonnie and [[King Maine]]|250px|link=http://www.farfarawaysite.com/section/peaky/gallery4/gallery6/hires/25.jpg]]Aberama accompanies Bonnie to his boxing match against [[Alfie Solomons]]' nephew, nicknamed [[Goliath]] for his size, and stays by his son at ringside. Aberama concentrates on his son so much that he never realises that the match is a trap to attack the Shelbys. When Bonnie wins, Thomas enters the ring and announces that Arthur has been murdered by Changretta's men.  

Afterwards, Aberama comes and gets Michael as Polly asks. After the Shelbys end the war with Changretta, he and his son join the Peaky Blinders' party where he and Polly stand together. 

=== Series 5 · 1929 ===
In the beginning of Season 5, Aberama participates in the assassination of a pimp in East London with Finn Shelby and Isiah Jesus, treating Finn Shelby after taking a bullet.

Aberama's relationship with Tommy begins to cause issues for him when he is approached by the Billy Boys and shot in the shoulder. His son, [[Bonnie Gold]] is also killed by Jimmy McCavern to send a message to Tommy and the Shelby family. He takes and injures Johnny Dogs as he suspects it was him who gave up their location to the Billy Boys and took him to Tommy's house, where Lizzie Shelby ends the struggle between Johhny, Tommy and Aberama after firing a gun and ordering everybody to get away from her house. Tommy ignores Lizzie's order and orders her to call an Ambulance for Aberama, who nearly lost his arm.

Against Tommy's orders, Polly helps Aberama to break out of the hospital. After congratulating Polly on her 45th birthday by giving her a rose, Aberama is helped out of the Polly's car by his sister, whom he asks to get his hunting rifle, 50 bullets, a car, a driver and to find out where the Fury family is camped as he needs their men to help him in Scotland. He and the Fury family are later seen ambushing members of the Billy Boys, killing several of them. The next morning he is saved from an ambush of the Billy Boys by Arthur Shelby, who was sent by Tommy and takes him back to England.

He later gets the blessing of Tommy to marry Polly (despite it being her idea) and is welcomed into the Shelby family. He is privy to their plans to kill [[Oswald Mosley]] and agrees to participate only because Tommy allows him to kill McCavern. While attempting to kill McCavern, however, he is ambushed and stabbed to death.
