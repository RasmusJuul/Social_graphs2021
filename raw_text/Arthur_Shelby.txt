==Character History==
[[File:Arthurww1.jpg|thumb|Arthur during the First World War in 1914.]]
Arthur is more brawn than brains. During the war in France, Arthur was a Sapper with his brother [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]], digging very treacherous tunnels in order to place enormous amount of explosives under the enemy positions: a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect at both the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. It is suggested he may have served at Gallipoli through his distaste for Turks and the smell of stagnant water.
=== Series 1 · 1919===
[[File:Ep1 1 b.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Arthur Shelby]] and [[Chester Campbell|Chief Inspector Campbell]]]]
After returning from France, Arthur feels that he should be the head of the family business. However, he can't command the necessary authority and Thomas slowly starts to assume leadership.

When [[Chester Campbell|Chief Inspector Campbell]] comes to Birmingham, Arthur is arrested, beaten and questioned as the assumed leader of the gang, but knows nothing about any stolen machine guns.

Eventually, Arthur Shelby confronts Thomas telling him that he has no idea what is going on. Thomas tells him that the Peaky Blinders have the stolen guns and takes him to [[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]], which is now under Arthur's ownership.

Arthur continues to show his lack of guile, when he hints to his barmaid [[Grace Burgess]] that [[Danny Whizz-Bang]] is alive, allowing her to surmise that Danny's grave is where the Peaky Blinders have hidden the guns.

[[File:Ep1_5_a.jpg|thumb|Arthur Shelby Sr.  and Arthur Shelby Jr. |left|250px]] 
When his father, [[Arthur Shelby Sr.|Arthur Shelby]], comes back to Birmingham, Arthur Jr. takes the opportunity to prove to everyone that he knows business just as well as Thomas. He gives his father money without the permission of Thomas or [[Polly Shelby|Aunt Polly]], but soon realizes that his father is a selfish liar. Arthur tries to confront his father before he leaves for good, but becomes intimidated by the man's strength and anger, knowing that he wouldn't win in a fight against him.

The events cause Arthur to re-evaluate himself and as a result, he attempts suicide by hanging himself. The plan fails when the rope tears from the hook.

Arthur and the rest of the Peaky Blinders eventually confront their rival [[Billy Kimber]] and help to clean Thomas Shelby's wounds after the shooting.

=== Series 2 · 1922===
An increasingly unhinged Arthur continued to struggle with war trauma when he kills a young boy in the boxing ring by beating him to death. He is later confronted in The Garrison Pub by [[Mrs. Ross]], the mother of the boy he killed. She pulls a gun on him, but it misfires and shoots the mirror behind the bar. Arthur lunges toward her, empties the gun of bullets and tells her that she’ll be compensated financially. Broken and furious, she flips over the table and screams, ''“Somebody has to stop you people”''.

Arthur accompanies Thomas and the gang to the auctions to buy a racehorse, thus giving them a credible reason to infiltrate the racecourses dominated by their London rival, [[Darby Sabini]]. When assassins try to kill Thomas, the same uncontrollable rage takes over Arthur who brutally beats one of the assailants.
[[File:Ep2 4 Arthur eden.jpg|thumb|250px|Arthur attacks The Eden Club]]
In London, Arthur, whose cocaine habit is worrying his younger brother, leads the Blinders in tearing up [[the Eden Club]] belonging to Sabini, which they plan to take over, quite hostilely.

Later, Arthur and John are drinking in The Garrison Pub, when his Aunt Polly's son [[Michael Gray]] and [[Jeremiah Jesus]]’ son, [[Isaiah]], come in telling them of a scuffle they had in [[The Marquis of Lorne]]. Arthur and his brother [[John Shelby|John]] burn the pub to the ground with the barman inside, to protect the reputation of the Peaky Blinders.
[[File:Ep2 5 Arthur Billy.jpg|thumb|250px|Arthur and Billy Kitchen ]]
When their supposed ally [[Alfie Solomons]] invites Arthur and [[Billy Kitchen]] over for Passover at the distillery, things escalate rather quickly after Alfie sacrifices the goat named after Thomas. Alfie shoots Billy Kitchen in the head and his men tie up Arthur to wait for the police to haul him off to jail for the murder.

In prison, Arthur is beaten badly. He gets a visit from his brother John, who tells him that Thomas has plans to get him released, not before mocking him: "You’ve tried to hang yourself twice, now the king’s going to do it for you”.

Thomas negotiates a deal with Alfie to have the murder charge against Arthur withdrawn just in time to join the Blinders and the Lees heading off to the races.

At the [[Major Races|Epsom Derby]], Thomas assassinates Field Marshal [[Field Marshal Henry Russell|Henry Russell]], which creates the diversion that Arthur and the gang need to hold up [[Darby Sabini|Sabini’s]] bookmakers and burn their licenses, while the police are distracted.

=== Series 3 · 1924===
[[File:Ep-3.5-image.jpg|thumb|Arthur and Alfie Solomons|250px]]

This leads to Linda looking for a way to divorce Arthur, however she is shocked to find that nobody in Birmingham will divorce a Shelby and seeks out Lizzie for advice. Lizzie admits that she will have to go to London to divorce a Shelby. 

Things between the two become more strained when Mosley reveals that he has heard news that Linda has been spotted with another man while married to him. This angers Arthur, who hunts down the man and slashes his face, seemingly leaving him for dead. He is later confronted by Linda, who is angry as all she did was talk to the man. Linda pulls a gun on Arthur, but is shot by [[Polly Gray]] before she has a chance to pull the trigger. After the bullet is removed, Arthur pleads with Linda to leave the Peaky life behind and run away with him, however she declines, admitting that she is thankful she didn't kill him as death would be too good for him.

He also takes charge of ensuring Barney is in position with a clear line of fire at Mosley, reiterating that the plan is to shoot Mosley after Tommy gives the go ahead. When the plan fails, however, Arthur takes Tommy home, expressing his concern that Tommy is slowly losing his mind.

== Relationships ==
=== Thomas Shelby ===
Thomas is Arthur's younger brother and the two share a complex but close relationship. Despite being the oldest of the Shelby brothers, Arthur is not the leader of the Peaky Blinders, which is something that often comes between the two brothers, with Arthur frequently trying to prove himself to Tommy. Despite this, Tommy purchases their local pub, [[the Garrison]], putting Arthur in charge — therefore there is an element of trust between the two brothers. 

Furthermore, the relationship between Thomas and Arthur becomes strained when Arthur attempts to commit suicide on many occasions, believing himself to be a failure. While Tommy shows his brother that he cares about him, he laughs at his failed attempts at suicide, simply retorting to do it properly next time.

=== Arthur Shelby Sr. ===
Arthur and his father initially shared a close, but similarly complex, relationship. Arthur was one of the only members of the Shelby family — and the Peaky Blinders as a whole — to welcome his father back to Birmingham, having left them as children in the care of [[Polly Shelby|their aunt]]. While Tommy and Polly do not welcome him back, Arthur finds himself caught up in his fathers plans to take money from the Peaky Blinders for his own use. To do this, he tricks Arthur into believing that they are to open a casino business, however his father tricks him, taking his £500 (worth around £6,500 present day) and disappearing. 
=== Linda Shelby ===
[[File:Ep3_1_Arthur_Linda.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur and his wife Linda|250px]]
Sometime between the years of 1922 and 1924, Arthur meets religious Linda, a devoted Quaker, and they marry. She helps Arthur put his life back together and deal with his mental health issues, firstly by helping him stay sober as much as she can.
=== Grace Shelby===
Arthur is seen having a soft spot for Grace in the [[Series 1|first series]] and often asks her for help with business calculations when he is having trouble. He accidentally slips out family business information to Grace, but makes sure to inform Thomas that Grace has been asking questions about how the family runs their business. In the [[Series 3|third series]], when Grace married Thomas, Arthur casually refers to her as his 'sister', indicating that he has welcomed her into the family despite her past history with the Shelby's.

===Michael Gray===
When Arthur first meets him, he tells Michael that he already knew him when he was a child: ''“I used to throw you out the window so John could catch you.”'' Just like John, Arthur treats Michael like a brother and makes sure to keep an eye out for his safety . Since Michael lost most of the money while in America and due to being suspected of betraying them Arthur along with Tommy acts very aggressively and mistrusting toward Michael. 

=== Finn Shelby ===
Both Arthur and John were initially the ones who looked after Finn during a night out however once John dies, Arthur needed a right-hand man which Finn was the only option as he was his brother but when Finn implies that he's unable to kill even when Arthur is under gunpoint, Arthur states that "''In the end, it is God who pulls that fucking trigger anyway." ''This illustrates that he doesn't necessarily care about that but rather having his brother there with him.

===Prostitutes===
Arthur is known to see women, two at a time on occasion, sometimes four but always multiples of two. As seen at the beginning of the [[Series 1|first series]] where he goes to the movies with two girls and receives sexual favors from both. It is unknown if these women are prostitutes. He also sleeps with the girls who work in [[The Eden Club]] while he runs it.
