'''Corporal''' '''Billy Kitchen''' was a Black Country man who briefly worked as "Head Baker" for [[Thomas Shelby]] and [[Alfie Solomons]]. While he posed as a baker, he in fact worked undercover as a member of the [[Peaky Blinders]] during their deal with Solomons. 
==Character History==
===Background===
The Black Country man served during the war with [[Thomas Shelby]]. Like Thomas, he won medals during the war and after the war was over, he threw them in the cut.

He took a bullet when the Sheffield mob showed up at the Wincanton Racing Track. He was cleared for medical by the time Thomas took him on to work.
===Series 2 · 1922===
He is part of the Shelby's payroll as Head Baker, with 100 men under his command, under the guidance of [[Alfie Solomons]] and [[Thomas Shelby]].

The Black Country men and the Brummies used to be on opposite sides, not even allowing Shelbys to let their boats pass through without being robbed, but since Billy's hiring, the two groups are on the same side again.

During [[Episode 2.4]], Billy heads with the [[Peaky Blinders]] to [[London, England]] to attack [[The Eden Club]] before heading back to Birmingham.

When Alfie Solomons switches sides and stops working with Thomas, and instead with Sabini, Billy and [[Arthur Shelby Jr.]] find themselves in a trap. Billy expresses concern to Arthur when the doors are shut, but decides to stay anyway. Alfie Solomons ends up informing the two that Thomas and the Peaky Blinders are no longer Alfie's allies by attacking both Arthur and Billy at a meeting. Minutes later, Billy is shot dead by one of Alfie's men.

==Relationships==
=== Thomas Shelby ===
Billy and Thomas are good friends, having worked together alongside one another during the war. There is an element of respect for one another, as Tommy drafts Billy into the ranks of the Peaky Blinders to work undercover, giving him the title "head baker".
