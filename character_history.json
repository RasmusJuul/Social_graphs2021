In short, despite Alfie's straightforward character and rationalization of his actions, he is completely untrustworthy unless people offer him the right price, and even then, there is no guarantee he won't switch sides halfway through the deal.\n\nMost of Alfie's income comes from racetrack rackets, although he also runs a rum distillery, jeweling business and protection rackets in Camden Town. However, his distrust of the police prevents him (initially) from putting them on his payroll, leaving him at a disadvantage against his rival Darby Sabini.\n\nAlfie is highly protective of Britain's Jewish community, warning all his Gentile employees that Jewish women are \"off the fucking menu\" and making generous donations to Jewish charities to help the blind, as one of his younger cousins was born without sight.

Realizing Tommy was probably bluffing, but knowing that he was, like Alfie, a Great War veteran (and therefore knew how to handle explosives) Alfie settled for 35% of Tommy's new business, and they resumed their alliance, driving Sabini away from Epsom completely and destroying his bookies' licenses.\n\n==", "Series 3": "===Series 3 \u00b7 1924===\n[[File:Alfieseries4.jpg|thumb|Solomons in Series 4|326x326px]]\nAlfie doesn't appear in Series 3 until the middle of the series, he is however mentioned by [[Polly Shelby|Polly]] when she tells Arthur and [[John Shelby|John]] that Alfie and [[Darby Sabini|Sabini]] have already sent flowers after Grace's death.

Alfie tells Thomas that his maid had said that his head was like 'a smashed up vase that what had been stuck back to together by a horse'. He remarks that he 'has been wandering around the streets of Birmingham naked, talking to dead people and believing that he can summon up Jews'. Thomas's plan is to have Alfie pose as his jeweller.\n\nSoon after, Alfie is in a meeting with Arthur and apparently wants to make peace after having set him up. However, he begins to torment Arthur by saying 'I hear you have allowed Jesus to enter your life, and I was wondering, how does that work considering your line of work, mate?' This infuriates Arthur, who nearly picks up an ashtray with the intent of smashing it over Alfie's head. Instead, he replies with 'I'm old testament' (eye for an eye).

Thomas asks Alfie for the names of people in the UK who would be interested in buying Faberge eggs, those would be interested in buying it even if it was stolen and then for those men with wives obsessed with Faberge eggs. Thomas then points a gun at his head saying that he left a name off the list and that saying that he 'crossed the line' by causing his son to be kidnapped.

Thomas again tries to kill Alfie but is stopped by Michael who tells him Solomons' death will break truces and create discord in London. Alfie refuses to be spared in the name of truce and reveals that the truces in London are already broken.

He also informed Tommy that the Sicilians aiding Lucca Changretta were being supplied by Darby Sabini in London, and that there were only eleven of them because they didn't trust anyone else; nonetheless, when Tommy asked him which side he was playing for, Alfie bluntly responded that he believed Tommy was going to fuck be dead soon. In turn, Tommy informed Alfie that the Mafia, being bootleggers by trade, were eager to get their hands on the source of production in England, especially since British policemen didn't carry firearms. He warned Alfie that if Lucca Changretta defeated the Peaky Blinders, he would probably come after Alfie, Sabini and the other gangsters of London next. Before the conversation went further, they were interrupted by Aberama Gold and his son Bonnie, whom Alfie compared unfavorably to his nephew, describing Goliath as \"that fucking\u00a0''thing''\u00a0right there, in whose shadow nothing good nor Godly will ever fucking grow.\"  \n\nNot long after, Changretta visited Alfie at his Camden Town rum distillery. Alfie claimed it was already obvious why they were there: Changretta wanted to make a deal to help him assassinate Tommy. Alfie initially dodged the offer, getting under Changretta's skin with his mockery, but quickly steered the conversation towards his price: he wanted the Mafia to smuggle his rum into the United States, where prices were much higher due to Prohibition. When Changretta claimed the demand for rum was down, as opposed to gin, Alfie told them they knew where the door was, knowing they weren't going to leave. He then listed various \"expenses\" he would need covered \"pertaining to the assassination of a dear friend\", continuing to anger Changretta with various anti-Italian insults. Changretta clarified that he didn't need Alfie to actually carry out or order the killing; he just needed to transport Changretta's assassins to the boxing match as his seconds. Alfie replied that they would need to be Jewish to serve as his seconds, which meant they would need to be circumcised, as the Peaky Blinders would strip-search them beforehand. Changretta impatiently agreed to all Alfie's demands. Surprised by the Mafioso's lack of negotiation, Alfie quietly mused in Yiddish that Tommy was right; Changretta ultimately intended to destroy all of them and take over. \n\nAlfie found Tommy before the boxing match and had a brief philosophical conversation, remarking ominously that \"big fucks small\" (referring both to his nephew against Gold, ''and'' to the Mafia against the Peaky Blinders), subtly both warning Tommy ''and'' justifying his choice to betray him. Immediately afterward, Alfie disappeared; the Mafia assassins he smuggled in ultimately strangled Arthur Shelby, rather than Tommy (though Arthur secretly survived). Changretta soon returned to Alfie's rum warehouse with more Mafia soldiers, intending to force the Jewish gangster to sell all his business to Changretta or be killed. However, Alfie had already fled, leaving his warehouse booby-trapped. Changretta and his men managed to discover the planted grenades at the last moment, then claimed the business as their own. However, soon after Changretta was lured into a trap by Tommy: having reflected on Alfie's mantra of \"big fucks small\", Tommy had made a  deal with even more powerful Mafiosi than Changretta, namely Al Capone, which resulted in Changretta's soldiers abandoning him and Changretta being killed by Arthur Shelby. \n\nKnowing Alfie had betrayed him, Tommy traced him to Margate, confronting him on a beach. Alfie revealed that he was suffering from skin cancer; he had ''intended'' for Tommy to discover his betrayal, track him down, and kill him so Alfie could die on his own terms, rather than the Mafia. Alfie asked Tommy to put him out of misery, however, Tommy was hesitant to pull the trigger, and tried to order Alfie to look him in the eye. Alfie shot Thomas in the side to provoke him to fire, and Tommy's shot struck his face, seemingly killing him. Tommy left Alfie's dog, [[Cyril]], on the beach with his prostrate owner. \n\n==", "Series 5": "=== Series 5 \u00b7 1929 ===\nDuring the last episode of series 5, Tommy goes to a seaside resort in Margate, where Alfie has been living in secret, watching ships and shooting at seagulls for his own amusement.

After being unconscious for a few hours, Alfie had been woken by the tide coming in. He mentioned multiple times that he was given a lot of drugs for his pain, wondering when Tommy learned that he'd survived. Tommy says Alfie wrote him a letter asking about his dog Cyril, which Alfie doesn't seem to remember (probably due to his injuries and the drugs). \n\nDespite Alfie being retired, Tommy claims he still has immense reach and influence within Britain's Jewish community; Alfie jokingly claims that since his 'resurrection' he has attained god-like status and has a statue in his likeness in the Holy Land.  However, he prefers to hide his survival from the public, as the police are no longer watching him. Despite claiming that he doesn't read the papers, Alfie is aware of the rise of the fascist Oswald Mosley, as well as Tommy's career in politics; he notes that Tommy is \"still at it\", but doesn't have a place to rest the way Alfie does.

It is implied by their aunt, Polly, who is their father's sister and Thomas himself when he states in Series 1 that the Lee Family are kin to the Shelby family from their mother's side. It can be concluded that perhaps both of Thomas' parents are partially Romani Gypsies, it is also implied that they have Irish Traveller ancestry too, as Polly mentions that, alongside Romani, they should not speak Shelta to [[Karl Thorne]], which is the language spoken by Irish Travellers.\n\nShelby was in love with a girl named Greta Jurossi before the First World War, as stated by [[Jessie Eden]]. Gretta grew sick, and Thomas stayed by her bedside for three months before she passed away and he went to war.\n\nIt is implied that there was a drastic personality shift before and after his experiences in the '''First World War''', during which he was a Tunneller or Sapper (a volunteer digging treacherous tunnels covertly, in order to place enormous amount of explosives beneath enemy lines, a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect)''. ''After the War, he began experiencing symptoms of [[PTSD|post-traumatic stress disorder]].[[File:Peaky Tommy Shelby.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Shelby in 1919.]]\n\nShelby is shown to be a member of the '''Small Heath Rifles''' at the rank of ''sergeant major'' \u2013 a non-commissioned officer in charge of well-being, morale and training of the entire unit (all other sergeants and corporals answer to him as well as to the actual commanding officers). His flawless conduct in this role (made even more difficult on account of his youth at the time) earned him unwavering respect both from members of his unit and other veterans alike and cemented his reputation in the streets.\n\nAs to his heritage, Thomas claims that he is related to the Lee family on his mother's side and [[Johnny Dogs]] claims that Thomas's grandfather was a \"king\", most likely a King of the Gypsies.

It is revealed that the horse is named \"Monaghan Boy\". He then returns to the Shelby residence for a family meeting. Upon learning that a [[Chester Campbell|new policeman]] is about to be stationed in Birmingham following the loss of a consignment of guns from the BSA factory, [[Polly Shelby]] takes Thomas aside and questions him on the matter. He reveals to her that [[Peaky Blinders|his men]] accidentally acquired the wrong crate during a routine pick-up, instead taking a crate that contained Lewis machine guns, ammunition, semi-automatic rifles, and pistols with shells.\n\nSeemingly heeding Polly's advice, Thomas says he'll dump the guns as soon as the full moon wanes, in the hope that the policemen won't pursue the matter further. After\u00a0[[Arthur Shelby Jr.]]\u00a0is forcibly taken to meet\u00a0[[Chester Campbell|Inspector Campbell]], and reveals that Campbell might want to work together with them to recover the missing consignment, Thomas, after a moment's pause, leaves the room without any further discussion of the matter. Some time after, as\u00a0[[Curly]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Charlie Strong]]\u00a0(Thomas's uncle) are preparing to drop the guns off, Thomas changes his mind about leaving the guns for the police to find, and has Curly drop the guns off at the old tobacco wharf, where the Peaky Blinders keep contraband cigarettes\u2014all in favour of some alternative strategy.\n\nLater, it is revealed that the new barmaid at [[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]], Grace, is an undercover agent working to recover the missing guns, when she meets with Campbell. She then informs Campbell that the leader of the Peaky Blinders is not Arthur, but Thomas.\n\nNot long later, Shelby, Arthur and\u00a0[[John Shelby]]\u00a0are in the countryside for the fair \u2014 also at the fair is the gypsy\u00a0[[Lee Family]]. An insult dealt to their mother by one of the Lee brothers results in a brawl, led by Thomas. On their return, Polly takes Shelby aside to tell him that Inspector Campbell wants to meet him. In return for the unwelcome police raid in Birmingham, Thomas instructs and orchestrates a\u00a0''mass burning''\u00a0of the pictures of the\u00a0''King'', and gets a reporter to cover this incident, drawing the attention and displeasure of\u00a0[[Winston Churchill]]\u00a0to Inspector Campbell.\n\nLater, while collecting his horse from Curly, Charlie presents a bullet with Thomas's name engraved on it \u2014 a declaration of war from the Lee clan. While on the streets, he is stopped by Grace when she tosses a bucket of spit before his horse, and he invites her to the\u00a0'''Cheltenham Races'''.\n\nOn his return to the Shelby home, Polly informs him of his sister\u00a0[[Ada Shelby|Ada]]'s pregnancy, and he storms off to find Ada at the cinema, demanding the identity of the father of her child.\u00a0\n[[File:Tommyww1.png|thumb|Shelby during the First World War.]]\nThe fixed race with the horse\u00a0''Monaghan Boy''\u00a0pays off, and the\u00a0[[Peaky Blinders]]\u00a0make a fortune. However, Thomas had fixed the race without the permission of\u00a0[[Billy Kimber]], the man who controls all the bookmaking sites at racecourses, and Polly chides him for it.\n\nAfterwards, Shelby reveals his plan to take over Billy Kimber's business when he meets Inspector Campbell and offers him a deal: in return for Inspector Campbell's (and the policemen's) non-interference with the work of the Peaky Blinders and the impending takeover of Billy Kimber's business, Thomas promises the removal of\u00a0[[Freddie Thorne]]\u00a0from the city as well as the missing guns to Campbell. Thomas ensures his own safety by telling Campbell that if he is taken into police custody, the guns will be dropped off at Liverpool, brought to Belfast and sold to the IRA. Campbell seemingly agrees to the deal, and Thomas leaves after making a snide remark at Campbell's deferment from the war.\n\nOne night, while in the throes of a nightmare, Curly wakes Thomas up and tells Thomas that the horse he bought from the fair is cursed, and the curse will soon spread to the heart of the horse. After Charlie deduces that this is the work of the Lee family, Thomas shoots his horse, then heads to the now-empty [[The Garrison|Garrison Pub]] for a drink, where he is served by Grace. He then reveals to her that, contrary to what she has said about her past, he knows she's never worked in any pub in Dublin, then goes on to (incorrectly) guess that she was a pregnant runaway, but promises Grace to keep it a secret.\n\nThe following day, Billy Kimber storms into\u00a0[[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]], demanding to see \"any man named Shelby\". The Shelby brothers, and Thomas in particular, receive the wrath of Billy Kimber, who accuses Thomas of fixing the races, and subsequently threatens to shoot them. Thomas, however, politely offers to strike a deal with him; given that both Thomas and Billy Kimber are at war with the Lee family, Thomas proposes to work with Billy Kimber to beat the Lee family to both their advantages. Though Kimber doesn't accept their offer immediately, they come to a truce because of Thomas's overly respectful appearance.\n\nThe following day, [[Grace Shelby|Grace]] asks Thomas for two more shillings to pay for her dress; he tells her to buy something coloured red. Meanwhile, two IRA members meet with Thomas at [[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]], telling him they would pay good money for the stolen guns from the BSA factory, should the Peaky Blinders gang be or come into possession of them. Thomas confronts Freddie Thorne \u2014 who still hasn't left the city \u2014 telling him that his marriage to Ada will not last. Meanwhile [[Sergeant Moss]] threatens Thomas, telling him that Ada will be thrown in jail for sedition if Thomas does not deliver Freddie to the police.[[File:TommyShelbyHome.png|thumb|250px|Shelby in the\u00a0[[Shelby Home]]]]As a gesture to gaining his trust, Shelby also warns\u00a0[[Billy Kimber]]\u00a0that the Lee family is going to be at the Cheltenham races, and that they are planning on robbing Kimber\u2019s bookies.\n\nThomas has another nightmare of the war, and the next day heads to Cheltenham with Grace. After taking back Kimber's money from the Lees, he makes a deal with Kimber, offering members of the Peaky Blinders to be used as security for Kimber. Kimber agrees, on the condition that he gets to spend a few hours with Grace. Initially [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]] agrees, but he heads to Kimber's mansion and interrupts them, lying to Kimber that Grace has the clap, thereby saving her.\n\nThomas leaves the Shelby home unattended (except for\u00a0[[Scudboat]]) as John calls a family meeting. Upon re-arriving at the home, Thomas and his family find the place trashed, and they find wire cutters, indicating that somewhere a hand grenade is hidden. Thomas realizes the hand grenade is for him, and finds his brother\u00a0[[Finn Shelby|Finn]]\u00a0playing with his car. He saves Finn and throws the grenade, and tells Finn to never pretend to be him, as his life is in constant danger.\n\nThomas goes to the Lee family to settle the dispute between the Lees and the Shelbys once and for all, claiming that he is related to the Lee family on his mother\u2019s side, Thomas tells them that he will be betraying Billy Kimber, and that he needs men to help. In exchange, he marries his brother John to a Lee family member named\u00a0[[Esme Shelby|Esme]]\u00a0to join their families.\n\nThomas delivers to Inspector Campbell the address of Stanley Chapman, a communist, instead of Freddie Thorne. Billy Kimber meanwhile hands Thomas the\u00a0[[Shelby Company Limited]]\u2019s first legal racetrack pitch.\n\nThomas brings Grace to the\u00a0[[Catholic Church]], knowing that she is a liar and confronts her about it. He also offers her a job and compliments her, telling her she has an air of class, and he kisses her. He gives Grace her first job, telling her to invite Ada to John\u2019s wedding with Esme. After the wedding ceremony, Thomas allows Freddie to see his newborn son, but Grace reveals Freddie\u2019s location to the police and Freddie is taken into custody.\n\nShortly after Freddie is arrested, Thomas tells Grace to mark a specific date on the business calendar\u2014'''\u2018Black Star Day\u2019''', the day in which he will take out Billy Kimber and his men at the races.\n\nAn Irishman named\u00a0[[Malacki Byrne]]\u00a0visits Thomas at\u00a0[[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]], claiming that he is the cousin of one of the IRA men who had visited previously was shot and killed. He threatens Thomas, so Thomas admits that he has the stolen machine guns, but that he will sell them to him for the right price. Thomas later tells Inspector Campbell of [[Malacki Byrne|Malacki's]] situation and makes a deal so that he can give Byrne to the police.\n\nMalacki and Maguire enter the pub, where Grace is hidden at the back with a gun. Thomas speaks with them, and they tell him that they will kill him. Grace reveals herself and shoots Maguire dead, while Thomas fights with Malacki until finally killing him. The police enter far later than they had promised to Thomas, and take away the bodies.\n\nAfter Inspector Campbell finds the machine guns in the fake grave of\u00a0[[Danny Whizz-Bang]], he hunts for Thomas at [[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]], but Grace takes Thomas to her home, thereby saving his life. At Grace\u2019s small home, they have sex and Thomas asks her if she\u2019ll stay with him.\n\nThomas comforts his brother\u00a0[[Arthur Shelby Jr.|Arthur]]\u00a0after Arthur attempts suicide, despite the fact that Arthur had stolen money from the Shelby family for their father. He informs Arthur that he is now an equal shareholder of the\u00a0[[Shelby Company Limited]], and that he owns 1/3 of the company, as do Thomas and\u00a0[[John Shelby|John]].\n\nThomas informs the\u00a0[[Peaky Blinders]]\u00a0that today is\u00a0''\u2018Black Star Day\u2019'', the day in which they take out Kimber and the Lee clan. He discovers Grace\u2019s betrayal, and faces Billy Kimber alone in front of [[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]] with his gang of Peaky Blinders and their machine gun and rifles. Billy Kimber manages to shoot Thomas in the chest, but Thomas is able to shoot him in the head, killing him instantly and ending the short war between the two gangs. Thomas leads a goodbye ceremony to Danny Whizz-Bang, who was killed during the event by Kimber\u2019s men.\n\nThomas writes a letter to Grace telling her that he will give her his decision (whether or not to leave the city with her) in three days.\n\n==", "Series 2": "=== Series 2 \u00b7 1922 ===\nThomas, along with his aunt Polly, find [[The Garrison|The Garrison Pub]] destroyed as a result of bombs with confetti.

He is told by them that he is to carry out an assassination.\n\nThomas calls a family meeting, informing everyone that he is planning on expanding the family business to London. He heads to London with his brothers John and Arthur, visiting a jazz club run by\u00a0[[Darby Sabini]].\n\nBack in\u00a0[[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]], Thomas is held and beaten by Sabini\u2019s men, while his sister Ada is abducted. Sabini\u2019s men attempt to kill Thomas but he is saved by Chester Campbell.\n\nHaving saved him earlier from Sabini's men, [[Chester Campbell|Inspector Campbell]] meets Thomas in the hospital, where he further threatens him. Thomas discharges himself out of the hospital, and with the medical help of [[Curly]] , heads to [[Camden Town]] to meet with [[Alfie Solomons]] . Upon his return, he informs Ada that he bought her a house in London, and proceeds to buy [[Polly Shelby]] another house in Birmingham, as her birthday present.\n\nThomas writes a letter to Campbell's handler [[Winston Churchill]] , asking for an export licence in return for going along with Campbell's plan for an assassination.\u00a0\n\nThomas is also able to discover what happened to Polly's children. The girl died of spring fever, but he locates the boy, [[Michael Gray]] . After meeting the boy, Thomas tells Polly that she must wait until he\u2019s 18 years of age to meet him, otherwise the boy will be taken from her again.\n\nThomas also receives a letter from [[Grace Shelby|Grace]], but burns the letter before reading it. \n\nNow in better shape, thanks to Curly, Thomas and his new recruits head to [[Camden Town]] with aims of starting work with\u00a0[[Alfie Solomons]]\u00a0and his new army of bootleg distillers \u2014 who pose as bakers amid fears of being exposed. The Peaky Blinders take interim leadership from [[Billy Kitchen]], the \"Head Baker\".\n\nThomas meets up with\u00a0[[Chester Campbell|Major Campbell]], pointing out that the Birmingham police have amusingly put him up in a hostel run by a semi-retired prostitute and brothel owner, indicating that they know of Campbell's secret activities.\n\nAlong with his brothers [[John Shelby|John]] and [[Arthur Shelby Jr.|Arthur]], Thomas hires men to get themselves arrested overnight on purpose. One of their recruits is the [[Digbeth Kid]], and the plan goes wrong when the boy gets murdered in his cell by [[Darby Sabini]]'s men. Thomas calls a family meeting about the incident, and informs his family of his plan to buy a racehorse, thus giving them a credible reason to infiltrate the race courses dominated by Sabini's men. \n\nAt the auctions, Thomas meets the aristocratic [[May Carleton]] and sees in her an opportunity to move up in the world. \n\nAfter their plan goes south, leading to the death of one of their own, [[Thomas Shelby|Thomas]]\u00a0attends the funeral of the\u00a0[[Digbeth Kid]], only to get a slap in the face from a mourner, before paying off the family for their trouble.\n\nHe then makes his way to meet\u00a0[[Chester Campbell|Inspector Campbell]], who needs him to carry out another assassination, this time of Field Marshal\u00a0[[Field Marshal Henry Russell|Henry Russell]]. Upon arrival, he realises Campbell and the pro-Treaty Irish Republicans have been working together all along. Thomas informs Campbell that\u00a0[[Donal Henry]]\u00a0is a spy reporting every word Campbell tells him back to the anti-treat Paddies, and that he\u2019ll carry out the assassination is if Donal is killed. Henry\u2019s body is soon found in a pile of coal, and Thomas starts planning the assassination.\n\nIn London,\u00a0[[Arthur Shelby Jr.|Arthur]], whose cocaine habit is scaring his younger brother, leads the Blinders in tearing up the [[Eden Club]] belonging to Italian ganglord\u00a0[[Darby Sabini]].\u00a0\n\nThe Blinders are in need of a new accountant, and thus Thomas ends up arguing with Polly over whether or not he'll hire Michael for the job. They eventually come to an agreement.\u00a0\n\nThomas has hired\u00a0[[May Carleton]]\u00a0to train his new horse, whose name is [[Major Races|Grace\u2019s Secret]]. He invites himself over to May Carleton's mansion to see just how the other half live and get a progress report on his horse. Thomas then later ends up having sex with May later that night.\n\nOn Thomas's return to Birmingham he receives the details of his assignment from Campbell. Thomas assures Campbell that if he is killed, he\u2019ll have Campbell killed as well.\u00a0\n\nIn Thomas\u2019s office, he pulls out a letter, dials a number, asks to be connected to the [[:Category:Places|Ritz Hotel]] in London, and waits. On the other end, a spiffy dude with a New York accent picks up. Thomas doesn\u2019t say anything and disconnects from the line.\n\nNot too long after, Thomas is caught by surprise when his powerbase in London is obliterated, and when his brother [[Arthur Shelby Jr.]] and cousin [[Michael Gray]] are thrown in jail.\n\nThomas holds a family meeting to figure out how many losses the gang and their connections have taken due to the coppers raiding their bars and business setups. He meets with [[Chester Campbell|Inspector Campbell]] at [[Catholic Church|The Catholic Church]]. Campbell simply informs Thomas that his reason for throwing Arthur and Michael in jail was to motivate Thomas to properly carry out his task of killing [[Henry Russell]].\n\nThomas takes [[Grace Burgess]] to see Charlie Chaplin in person and ends up spending the night with her, where she tells him that she has been trying to have a baby with her husband, but has fears that she may be the cause of her infertility issues. Thomas urges her to tell her husband the truth.\n\nThomas visits [[May Carleton]] and informs her that he can no longer continue their relationship as he still has feelings for Grace.\n\nHe also meets with Inspector Campbell to inform him of the new location of Henry Russell's assassination, which will take place at\u00a0the [[Major Races|Epsom\u00a0racetrack]] on Derby day.\n\nAfter being threatened several times, Thomas\u00a0writes a letter to the editor of the New York Times, explaining that [[Winston Churchill]] is having him perform a high-profile assassinations on behalf of the crown.

While doing business, Thomas is stopped by [[Grace Burgess]] who says she needs to speak with him as it is an important matter. Though Thomas seems slightly rushed and agitated he allows her to speak, Grace reveals that she still loves him and is pregnant, and that the child she is carrying is his. Thomas informs her that he will come and find her after the race.\n\nThomas enlists the help of Peaky Blinders member [[Lizzie Stark]], to help him carry out his plan by taking [[Henry Russell]] to somewhere private at the races.\n\nThomas\u2019s plan, however, does not go to plan, finding himself delayed in getting to Lizzie, who is sexually assaulted by the Field Marshal Henry Russell. When Thomas does arrive, his gun jams, but he grabs his target\u2019s own pistol and shoots Russell dead.\n\nThomas's smug showdown with a supposedly defeated\u00a0[[Darby Sabini]]\u00a0is ruined when Campbell\u2019s hired men of [[The Red Right Hand]] rush and kidnap Thomas, placing him in a vehicle and driving off.\n\nThomas is carted out to an abandoned field where he faces certain death. He faces his execution with a mixture of anger at the approaching end to his weary acceptance that death has stalked him much of his life. But after Thomas enjoys his final cigarette, one of the three would-be assassins shoots the other two in the head and leaves Thomas lying in a grave, confused and alive. The man says, \u201c''At some point in the near future, Mr. Churchill will want to speak to you in person, Mr. Shelby. He has a job for you.''\u201d He tells Thomas to go home.\n\nBack in his office,\u00a0Thomas speaks with [[Michael Gray]], who wishes to work for him as the Shelby Company expands.
