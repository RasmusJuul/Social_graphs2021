arthur.
john.
michael.
the chief constable of birmingham has issued a warrant for your arrest.
<i>i've made a deal with people even more powerful than our enemies.</i>
<i>trust me, brother.</i>
father.
what is it, sunday?
there's been a mistake.
there's an appeal process underway that doesn't begin until january.
i want to see my lawyer, mr patrick.
stop! this shouldn't be happening!
get your hands off me!
all right! i'm john shelby!
.. clean up when i come back.
when i come back i gotta be clean.
whatever i said, whatever i decided.
whatever i decide...
michael? michael?
arthur!
- arthur!
- john!
where's tommy?
- arthur! arthur!
- no!
no.
arthur, you have to call the king.
- about what?
- about this.
this is the case of a family of birmingham gangsters on trial for murder and sedition.
why would the king intervene?
the leader of the gang, thomas shelby.
he claims his family was caught up in a wider conspiracy.
he names winston churchill.
- you woke me up for this?
- and he also sent us this.
how the fuck did a birmingham racketeer get his hands on a personal letter written by king george?
during a robbery at hampton court,
shelby discovered a box of correspondence.
among the papers he stole was that letter from the king himself, which proves his majesty was involved.
oh, utter fuck.
<i>if his family walks free,</i>
<i>then he will burn the papers in my presence.</i>
<i>when are they due to hang?</i>
today. this morning in winson green prison.
why the hell didn't you bring it up before?
the plan was for the lord chamberlain to intervene at the appeal but late last night some localjudge brought the executions forward.
oh, my giddy aunt.
put me through to his majesty.
well, wake him up!
in the bleak midwinter.
in the bleak midwinter.
thy kingdom come. thy will be done...
help, lord jesus, with this rope pull me up to heaven.
i see your face shining down on me.

<i># no heaven, no hell

<i># no heaven, no hell #</i>
also, sir, in return for burning the king's letters
thomas shelby has asked for something else.
inclusion in this year's
new year's honours list.
thomas shelby has asked for the king to award him an obe, sir.

mr shelby?
tomorrow.
so, maria or clara?
or elizabeth?
it's christmas.
someone new, billy.
i've wrapped all charlie's presents and left them in the room.
what did i get him?
toy horses, toy cars, toy guns.
you're due at the singer factory at eight tomorrow, not eight thirty, there's a union problem.
righty-oh.
and the driver will take you home.
i'll drive meself.
goodnight lizzie, have a good christmas.
- i'll have a vodka tonic.
- yes, ma'am.
tommy, i've had christmas cards from
john, arthur, ada, michael and polly.
and an invitation,
new year's.
party atjohn's house.
a party at john's big house, good for him.
ada's coming back from boston for it.
i know.
it was me who gave her the time off.
why don't you come?
just turn up, bring charlie, bring a lump of coal, first footing.
dark-haired man crosses the threshold to bring good luck for the new year.
hm?
the babies will make everybody okay, babies stop everything.
can't pull a razor with a baby there, not even esme.
just come.
see what happens.
tommy, you've never even seen
arthur's kid, norjohn and esme's.
your drink, madam.
thank you.
billy...
who did you get for me?
- theresa.
- i said someone new.
understood.
do it for charlie.
charlie should know his cousins.
i'll get charlie a real horse, lizzie.
not a toy, a thoroughbred.
and on christmas day it'll be just you and charlie.
and the horse.
can't live like this another year.
sex, freedom, whiskey sours.
which one should i give up first,
lizzie, eh?
i got you something.
merry christmas.

<i># i adore life</i>
i told you you didn't need to come on christmas eve,
i could've dealt with it.
yeah, like you dealt with it at the pressings factory.
well, this is the same problem.
same fucking union convenor.
area convenor for the boiler makers union has got involved with something that could've otherwise been fixed with a drink and a bribe.
- a wire cutting shop?
- hmm, and all the wire cutters here are women, that's why the union convenor thinks they're being underpaid.
well, tell him there are no men in the cutting shop so there can be no comparatives.
- it's a woman.
- what is?
the union convenor causing all the trouble.
fuck.
her name'sjessie eden.
- you heard of her?
- yeah.
do you want me in the meeting?
no.
michael?
look, sometimes i have a sniff of snow, so what?
how's your mother?
i drove past her house, the drainpipe was hanging off.
look, the cocaine keeps me awake.
very long hours these days and when i do sleep
i dream about what happened.
i wasn't asking about you,
michael, was i?
i was asking about your mother.
since she was pardoned she's been on these fucking tablets the doctor gave her when she was in the prison.
she says that when she was inside the noose she saw spirits.
she's running sã©ances but people just come into the house to steal things.
- tommy, it's bad.
- all right, all right.
all right, listen to me, michael.
the spirits she sees... are real.
believe they're real.
believe it with her.
and eventually, you can take the remembered noose from around her neck, like a horse that's been choked off.
keep her off whiskey, throw away the tablets, and stop giving her fucking snow.
fuck, tommy, sounds like family advice.
you coming back?
nothing to come back to.
truth is they're all fucked.
the lot of them.
yeah.
find out about that woman, jessie eden.
don't let your mother keep cash in the house. and oi, no cocaine on the registered premises.
did you see they all came?
yeah, i saw you at the back.
it's funny they don't notice.
oh, my sweet.
oh, my heart.
crushed to death in the canal... but back home again.
it's so beautiful.
inside the loop.
inside the merry loop.
for fuck's sake.
fucking birds.
ada.
come on.
<i># salvation</i>
<i># alas salvation</i>
<i># gilded lily nest of vipers never ever did invite us #</i>
thought we lost you to the great white way of broadway.
no.
well, this beats watery lane, john.
does it?
here, take a seat, i'll grab the kids.
no, it's all right,
i'm not stopping.
just wanna drop those presents off for tomorrow.
i don't want words on christmas eve.
well, it's my house, you're welcome.
it's okay, i'm staying with polly.
huh, she's in a bad way.
mm. i'll bring her to her senses.
- michael's already tried that.
- i'll get through to her.
you still gonna come to the party on new year's eve?
yeah, who else is coming?
arthur, linda.
hello, esme.
who paid for your car and driver, ada?
shelby company limited.
nice car, treats you well, his last little pet.
look, this visit is meant to be about making things all right.
john had a rope around his neck, he shit himself.
all right, esme, that'll do, yeah.
go on, go in the kitchen.
take the cars back to the money.
anyway, there's your presents.
how's arthur?
uh, for christmas get him a sewing kit, so he can sew his fucking balls back on.
maypole 245.
hello, esme.
there you go, look, couple of eggs, eh, two eggs.
off you go.
arthur, be careful with billy in there, there's a cock.
yeah, i will.
and don't smoke that near him.
all right.
get out of it.
esme called to say
ada's on her way over.
did you hear that, billy boy?
your auntie ada's coming, all the way from america.
bye, chickens.
oh, we dropped an egg, look.
we dropped an egg, billy boy.
give him the hell he gives us,
miss eden.
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks</i>
<i># where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom</i>

<i># where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires... #</i>
excuse me. this is the gents' lav.
you don't have a women's lavatory on the second floor, because no women get this far up.
if you don't have a women's lavatory
i can't go to it, can i?
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand #</i>
you say there is a disparity in pay based on sex.
the male wire cutters in the rover factory, a mile and a half down the road are paid ten shillings a week more than the female wire cutters here.
different factories, different rates.
but both factories are owned by you, mr shelby.
not in your own name, of course, in the name of arrow house holdings.
you own the manchester
car and van factory in the name of tilton company limited, the billings machine tools factories at hay mills and greet in the name of
stechford engineering.
the bilstone forgings and presses
factory in the name of canalside and the canal warehousing in gas street.
saltley in cadbury in the name of
shelby company limited, also 255 streets of back to back houses.
very good.
very good.
so this isn't about women and men, it's about me, eh?
tommy shelby, obe.
no, it's not about you.
it's about disparities.
it's about ten shillings a week for working mothers so they can buy shoes for their kids.
- never had shoes meself.
- so now you deny others?
and barefoot i grew up mean.
oh, i know.
oh, yeah, you know everything.
- your turn of phrase...
- is unacceptable?
you grew up mean you say.
threat in there i think somewhere.
no threats.
the whole of birmingham knows you, mr shelby.
sweetheart, whatever you've heard
i don't need to make threats.
my comrade brothers and sisters...
your brothers and sisters!
all right, listen,
i will conduct myself as a businessman.
who says sweetheart.
you say there's a ten shilling disparity between male and female cutters in two of my factories.
very well.
i will increase the pay of the female cutters in this factory by five shillings and i will cut the pay of the male cutters in the rover by five shillings, thereby achieving your sacred fucking parity.
and i will tell the men with families to feed whose idea it was to cut their pay.
you do that, i will bring all my members out on strike.
oh, yeah?
a week after christmas, you think so?
you know, everything you've said here today and the fact that we're having this meeting today tells me that you're a woman without a family.
and everything i hear about you tells me you're a man without a family as well.
my comrade brothers and sisters are not afraid of you, mr shelby.
i will call an extraordinary meeting of my executive committee as soon as boxing day.
you will hear the whistles blow all across birmingham.
i've heard lots of whistles blow, sweetheart.
the post has arrived, mr shelby.
i'm sorry to keep asking but chef needs to know how many for dinner tomorrow.
he's new, he's foreign, he gets very upset.
right. well, you tell chef there'll be 27 guests for christmas dinner tomorrow.
twenty-seven?
- family?
- yep.
i thought charlie could do with some company so i asked johnny dogs if he knew anyone who liked to eat goose and he said he knew 26.
tell chef i want ten geese, a buck cut into steaks, some trout from the river, fetch whisky, brandy and wine from the cellar, best we have.
there will be children?
lots of children.
with johnny's tribe, new ones might be born on the floor, so have... have mops and buckets ready, eh?
and i want you at the table, frances, so make it 28.
i will be busy.
you've put up with me this past year, looked after charlie when i've been on business, tomorrow you will eat at my table.
things will get better,
i think, next year.
uh-huh.
gets much warmer than here in the summer, much colder in the winter.
i knew it.
but parts of it are just like birmingham.
yeah. shit and smoke the same everywhere.
hmm. what about you, linda?
you working?
i've been seeking work as a teacher.
- teacher.
- hmm, but you know, it's quite difficult. the shelby name is always in the papers.
and, uh, what do you get up to all day, arthur?
as you know arthur's previous endeavours have left us with no need for a salary.
arthur occupies his time in the garden, doing voluntary work.
he drives old people and cripples.
- oh.
- yeah, well, something to do.
i wanna open a garage.
- someday.
- fixing cars, you know?
sometimes cars attract ambitious men.
yeah, but...
- i like fixing cars.
- hmm.
i'll go.
i got it.
maypole 244.
arthur, have you checked your post?
i just got served a black hand.
i just got delivered a black fucking hand to the house from luca changretta.
jesus.
jesus christ!
wait a minute, john, which one's luca?
<i>the old man's oldest son.</i>
<i>he was gonna get done for killing a bank clerk in a robbery.</i>
<i>so his old man sent him back to new york.</i>
you know what the black hand means among the wops, arthur?
it's mafia shit.
the sicilian fucking mafia.
<i>just check your post, arthur.</i>
arthur, i was just leaving.
no, you're not.
i need... i need to talk to you.
- arthur?
- it's all right, linda.
stay here. ada, please?
linda, you stay here.
did you say mafia?
esme, i need to make a call.
- no.
- i need to make a fucking call.
- give it here!
- what the fuck is this?
- give it here!
- tell me what the fuck it is.
- give it here.
- what is it?
it's from luca changretta,
all right? we killed his dad.
i remember.
it was tommy who killed him.
it was fucking...
arthur pulled the trigger.
all right, it was mercy, but it was arthur.
anyway, it makes no fucking difference.
for the wops it's family.
the black hand came here, everybody will have got one.
they're coming for us all.
we made an agreement.
we made a solemn promise.
we're the family now.
here, look at that.
that's from changretta's son, luca.
how the fuck he knows where i live, eh?
and why has he waited a year?
i'm gonna see tommy next,
i'll talk to him.
i've been served a black hand and she won't even let me keep a fucking spud gun in the house.
go to a hotel.
it's christmas eve, ada.
i've got a gun in the glove compartment, you take that for now.
i'll talk to tommy and have him call, just make sure you get to the phone first.
- yeah.
- now, hug me like you came out here
'cause you were emotional.
i am emotional.
i just don't know what fucking emotion it is.
it'll be okay. i'll talk to tommy.
you talk to him.
you and me both, brother.
ada?
you wait there.
you won't leave empty-handed, here you go, look.
some eggs, you get them to polly, all right?
and you, keep your eyes on the road.
- take care.
- mm.
who was on the phone, arthur?
john, wishing me merry christmas.
come inside, it's getting late.
thanks.
take off the hat.
are you with those other italians?
we're americans, says it right there on the paper.
usa.
and what's the purpose of your visit?
pleasure.
mum? it's me.
- left the door open.
- to change the air.
i told you i was busy today, what do you want?
why haven't you opened your post?
tidied up.
ada's coming today.
she's late.
tommy asked about you today.
i hope ada's car hasn't broken down.
shelby company limited still using bentleys?
yeah.
bentleys are no good in the cold.
you should tell him.
i will.
any other messages for tommy?
yeah, fuck off.
he saw that your drainpipe was broken.
he's worried.
is that it?
is that all he asked about, drainpipes?
no, he said that i'm to accept that you have a gift.
that you've always had a gift.
what gift?
second sight.
spirits, all that gypsy stuff.
he said that i'm to believe you.
you think i don't hear his voice in yours?
you don't think
i recognise his strategies?
- i'm still a match for him.
- yes, you are.
and you still can be.
me and lizzie decided that this new year we're all to turn a page.
you can't spend another year like this, mum.
mum.
mum.
word is like a bullet to me.
see your sister in that chair sometimes.
look, me and lizzie decided.
it's time.
i bought these.
one for you and ada...
one for you and me.
so tommy said, keep her off the whisky?
i'll drink champagne the day my son leaves the employment of shelby company ltd.
you tell him that next time he mentions fucking drainpipes.
right, now, this is your job, charlie.
now, give those to santa, and rudolf.
good boy.
leave this out for santa, that's whisky.
now, night-night. merry christmas.
i'll see you tomorrow.
all right? sleep well.
come on, charlie.
mr shelby, it's your sister.
i know. send her in.
i've had a card, ada. i'm guessing
arthur and john have had one as well.
"hello, tommy."
"hello, ada, welcome home."
"thanks, it's nice to be back."
i've spoken to moss.
moss says that changretta is a soldier for the spinetta family, which means that he'll have men with him, professional men.
they usually operate in units of around ten.
moss is checking cunard records to see if they're already in england.
this one's for you.
what is it, a time machine?
my god, tommy shelby, is that regret?
i'll open it tomorrow.
so, boss, in light of the changed circumstances, what are your orders?
changretta knows where we all live.
if we stay out in the open, isolated, he'll pick us off one by one.
we need to be together in a place even they won't dare to come.
you mean, back home?
within a four-mile radius of the garrison, every man is a guard and a soldier for us.
i'm calling a family meeting.
charlie strong's yard, boxing day.
finn's already there.
you tell polly and michael,
i'll deal with john and arthur.
and esme and linda?
anyone who wants to live to see another christmas needs to come where it's safe.
these bastards will kill kids as well.
when this business is finished we can... go our separate ways.
go and see polly and explain.
she'll have had a card as well.
do you think i'm on the list?
we're all on the list, ada.
i gave my gun to arthur.
welcome home.
hm.
holy shit.
- it's father christmas.
- yeah.
and if you're good you get what you deserve.
fucking come here, you.
fuck.
yeah, put me through to maypole 245.
<i>- hello?
- arthur, it's tommy.</i>
be quick, they're asleep.
family meeting, charlie's yard,
boxing day, midday.
i can't raise john but i'll send michael to get him.
if you have to pull a gun on linda, do it.
merry christmas.
merry christmas, tom.
what did you do with them?
my tablets were in the bathroom cabinet.
what did you do with them?
i threw them in the lavatory.
- tommy's orders?
- no. my own decision.
how am i gonna get through christmas without them? they close everything.
how am i gonna get through christmas without them?
- i'll help you.
- they don't open anything.
fucking no apocethary, nothing.
you can move in with me and i'll help you.
how am i gonna get through fucking christmas, without... without anything?
you can move in with me and i'll help you.
fuck off. fuck off.
fuck off, thomas shelby. fuck off.
it's all right, it was me.
i just want you to stop, just stop.
- i just want the tablets.
- this has got to stop!
tommy said to believe in spirits with you but i can't.
hello, polly. hello, michael.
merry christmas.
door was wide open.
fuck.
i spent the whole day tidying up,
i wanted it to be nice.
i wanted it to look nice.
all right, poll, it's only me.
it's okay. it's okay, we can sit.
sit and talk, we'll put things back together. it's okay.
- i'll leave you two to it.
- no, you stay.
now listen, something's happened.
things have changed.
today, everyone in the family received one of these.
- what does it mean?
- tommy's called a family meeting.
he wants you both to come.
come.
i'm really sorry to bother you again, sir, but chef insists on knowing what time the guests will arrive.
frances, for the last time, it's johnny dogs, they're gypsies, they're camped down by the river.
when they're ready they'll walk up.
all right?
- he says it's about preparation, sir.
- what is?
he's asked specifically, will they arrive before the king's speech or after?
you said he was new, this chef.
- when did he join us?
- october.
october.
and he's foreign?
- he's italian, sir.
- oh.
he's the best chef we've ever had in the house.
no shouting or swearing or blaspheming.
- do we know his references?
- yes.
the only problem has been his assistant.
what assistant?
he brought an assistant with him, he calls him his sous chef.
are they still working, frances?
they'll be there till midnight, sir.
all right, thank you.
goodnight, you can go to bed.
merry christmas, sir.
and i thought about your offer,
i'd be happy to sit at your table.
all right, thank you.
mr shelby.

you wanted to know if my guests would arrive before or after the king's speech.
- eh?
- yeah.
it'll be after.
how are you?
just... worried about tomorrow.
yeah, i'm worried about antonio.
he's been here two months and we've not met before, it's my fault.
i've been busy.
thomas shelby.
- my hand has blood.
- oh, mine too.
hey, how much do you pay antonio?
i forget.
must be a lot.
i just gave him â£10, didn't mean a fucking thing to him.
maybe it isn't you that pays him.
i've been reading up on you.
bertorelli, claridge's.
you used to work in a place called san marco's... on... on fleet street.
i used to know the man that owns san marco's.
a man called darby sabini?
- i've never met him.
- no.
maybe your, um, assistant...
antonio, maybe he's met him.
here's how it is.
- antonio was sent from new york?
- i don't know, please.
darby sabini facilitated.
he passed him onto you, told you to bring him into my house, threatened to kill you if you didn't do it.
do you want me to dress you like you dressed that fucking stag?
please, don't...
- you know about me?
- mmm-mmm.
all right.
- you know what i do?
- mmm.
you wanted to know when my guests would arrive
'cause antonio needed me alone.
he's an assassin, the plan is to kill me tomorrow.
i don't know.
they just said bring him here.
well, bring him here.
antonio...
oh.
huh?
you're a black hand!
you're a black hand!
how many came from new york?
eh? how many fucking came from new york?
what did he say? is that a curse or a number, what did he fucking say?
what did he fucking say?
- he said fuck you.
- yeah?
black hand means kill or be killed.
you go back to london, you tell darby sabini he picked the wrong side in this war.
once we've dealt with the americans we're coming for him.
go on, go.
go. oi!

this is the new york mafia we're talking about.
and we're the peaky fucking blinders.

tommy, you've never even seen arthur's kid. norjohn and esme's.
<i>- i'm staying with polly.
- she's in a bad way.</i>
i'll get through to her.
<i>the union convenor causing all the trouble. her name 'sjessie eden.</i>
i will conduct myself as a businessman.
who says sweetheart.
today, everyone in the family received one of these.
<i>changretta knows where we all live. we need to be together in a place</i>
<i>even they won't dare to come.</i>
<i>you mean back home?</i>
<i>this is the new york mafia we 're talking about!</i>
<i>and we 're the peaky blinders!</i>
<i>we're not the peaky blinders unless we 're together.</i>
- what's the purpose of your visit?
- pleasure.
<i># i began to warm and chill</i>
<i># to objects and their fields</i>
<i># a ragged cup, a twisted mop</i>
<i># the face ofjesus in my soup</i>
<i># those sinister dinner deals</i>
<i># the meal trolley's wicked wheels</i>
<i># and the mercy seat is waiting</i>
<i># and i think my head is burning</i>
<i># and in a way i'm yearning</i>
<i># to be done with all this
weighing of the truth</i>
<i># an eye for an eye

<i># to be done with all this
weighing of the truth</i>
<i># an eye for an eye

please, can we get some help here? please!
it's all right michael.
it's all right michael, i'm here.
it's all right michael, you're gonna be ok.
don't leave us now, just keep keep breathing.
no, no, i don't want fucking kids in here, i want soldiers.
i don't want fucking kids who joined just for the sport.
go on, go.
i want men who've served in here.
all right, poll.
mrs gray, please.
don't go, don't go...
he's in good hands.
polly? poll? poll?
fuck those bastards responsible!
all right, let them do their job, all right?
let them do their job,
i'll get soldiers.
i'll be back. i'll be back.
is it him?
yeah.
on his own doorstep.
his own fucking doorstep.
right, get out. and you, out.
what the fuck?
poorjohn.
fucking gone.
in the bleak midwinter.
we promised, arthur.
i can't.
in the hole we promised.
- can't look at him.
- come here brother.
come here. come on, come here.
oh, my!
now say it.
say it, brother.
in the bleak midwinter.
you're cursed and i curse you again!
come here, come here.
leave me with him.
you've spoken to him, now it's my turn.
arthur?
no peace for either of you, ever.
our stuff will stay with me.
taking the children on the road... to live with decent people.
they'll never know the curse side of this family.
we're done with them, john.
tommy, they're gathered.
john is dead.
esme's gone on the road with the lees.
she's taken the kids.
michael is badly wounded, they say it's 60/40 in his favour.
there's no number, there's no percentages.
so the hand, the hand beneath him stops him falling.
spoke to someone... my son will live.
michael and john were shot because we killed someone...
vincenzo changretta.
his son luca has come to take revenge.
men from new york and sicily are in birmingham.
these men will not leave our city until the whole family is dead.
that's how it works, an eye for an eye.
- it's called vendetta.
- yeah, well...
the bullet's been written...
it says luca.
when the time comes... and it will come... me as the oldest brother... will put this bullet into his fucking head.
there's been some bad blood between us.
polly, please?
until this business is settled we stay together.
we stay here...
small heath, bordesley,
hay mills down to greet.
we know every face, every man is a soldier in this army.
these men are professionals and they're good at what they do, so we're gonna need more than we have.
we send a message to aberama gold.
no. no, tom.
i'll get you 50 lee boys. good men, tom.
i don't need good men johnny, for this i need bad men.
tommy, his people are fucking savages.
you know, heathens, tom.
they don't even let them in the fair, so they come and steal our horses.
you know, stealing from their own, tom.
so this is the plan, thomas?
this is the plan?
bullet with a name on it, help from a bunch of savages.
we're gonna go on the offensive.
- i've spoken to moss.
- moss?
i've spoken to moss.
moss is putting out word.
eyes and ears so we can find them.
yeah, the truth is, the police are busy with the revolution.
moss says they're expecting strikes and riots when the weather gets warm and the bolsheviks plan to...
the bolsheviks couldn't plan a fucking picnic.
- he's reading the wrong papers.
- ada!
real, or not real, the coppers don't give a fuck about us, all right?
which means... that here today in this room... we have to agree to end this war between us.
take a vote.
peace.
i was never a part of this, but... peace.
peace.
peace.
peace.
shut up, finn.
why can't i say peace?
arthur, let him have his say.
finn? sit at the table.
little bastard...
sending a fucking kid,
sergeant major... to do men's work.
my son's not here to speak...
so i'll speak on behalf of us both.
truce.
five for peace.
two for truce, one abstension.
let's get on with the war.
whoa. curly, how are ya?
here, catch.
right, come on then, boys, unload, unload.
hat.
blues and villa goalkeeper?
dan tremelling plays in goal for the blues and tommyjackson for the villa.
fair enough.
- charlie?
- what is it, curly?
we've run out of bullets charlie.
we need more ammunition.
more ammunition.
johnny, more ammo.
we're like sitting ducks here if the wops come.
yeah, well, tommy said we should do it in the open.
this is howjohn wanted to go.
on the smoke.
and the truth is... we died together once before.
arthur, me,
danny whizzbang,
freddie thorne,
jeremiah, and john.
we were cut off from the retreat...
no bullets left, waiting for the prussian cavalry to come and to finish us off.
and while we waited...
jeremiah said, "we should sing,
'in the bleak midwinter.'"
but we were spared.
the enemy never came.
and we all agreed... that everything after that was extra.
and when our time came... we'd all remember.
you remember that god spared you.
but what did you do with that extra time that he gave you, eh, thomas?
at ease! at ease.
do not return fire.
i repeat, do not return fire.
stand down.
the men doing the firing are on our side.
i took the trouble... of giving an invitation to aberama gold.
oh fuck! now it's begun.
put it out in the open on purpose.
you used john's funeral fire as a fucking beacon.
we were never in any danger polly.
you set a trap.
finn? finn? go to the yard and light the fires.
you set a trap with us as fucking bait.
who's dead?
our enemies.
- who's dead?
- you wanna know, poll?
two fucking no good italians heard about the vendetta, tried to make a fucking name for themselves, that's who.
we got word to them about the funeral, the where, the when...
told them where to stand for the best shot.
and aberama gold would do the rest.
that's the language of vendetta, they take one of ours, we take two of theirs.
you used your own brother's funeral.
when did we vote on this, tommy?
curly, get a boat ready to take the bodies to the city.
and another boat for anyone, anyone who wants no more part of this.
'cause this is how it's gonna be.
polly?
i'm not staying for this, arthur, i'm going home.
oh, yeah? home's 57, watery lane.
you go there, lock the doors, you wait for me.
key to number 57.
i'm going home to the country.
you will stay here until it's over.
take the fucking key, linda.
look, away from here you are a weakness to all of us.
they will take you hostage and the baby, they will use the baby.
take it. put the kettle on, wait for your husband.
the only way any of you
shelbys will leave this place is on a cloud of smoke like john.
well, you're a shelby now too, linda.
five hundred each.
a thousand for the brace.
where do you want them?
charlie, take him to the yard.
not too far and not too deep, curly,
i need the message to get through.
okay, tommy.
finn, you go with him.
go on. go with him.
oh, tom, uh, telljanet to save me some goose, please.
on your feet.
wait outside.
hello, mum.
they said you'd be out cold.
no, don't move.
the doctor said they've sewn you up like a football.
what else did he say?
he said you took four bullets.
only one was live, one was ricochet...
two were already spent.
two had passed through john.
last thing i remember was his face.
i watched him go.
where's tommy?
oh, don't worry about tommy, just get better.
where is he?
tommy's back.
we're all back. garrison,
watery lane, charlie's...
- i need a cigarette.
- no.
i made a decision.
give me a cigarette, mum.
- it's not allowed.
- it's not allowed?
- i've decided we're gonna get away.
- mm, yeah?
just me and you, australia.
i've been to the cunard office and i've got a magazine.
- hmm.
- now, america's no good because that's where they are, but there's no italians in australia.
i think there are, mum.
bad ones, i mean.
have you stopped taking those prison tablets?
don't you worry about me.
well, i do.
and just you get better.
the doctor says it'll be five weeks, then you'll be up and walking.
now, there's a boat that leaves on february the 13th.
tell tommy i need to see him.
tell him to bring a gun small enough to fit in the chamber pot, in case...
i've banned tommy from coming.
the factory's coming back to work tomorrow.
just forget about the fucking factories.
is there any word of them going out on strike?
we can go to australia, it'll just be you, me, and your sister,
'cause i've found out where she was buried, somewhere outside melbourne.
listen, mum...
i'm gonna get better slowly.
but you need to get better fast.
without you he falls apart and without him... without him, they'll take us all.
you've got to get us through this.
and i promise...
i'll board that train with you and we'll go to australia.
i like your yard, mr strong.
how much would you take for it?
it's not for sale.
not for sale?
okay.
i just took a look around.
i like this place.
fire for melting silver, canal to get it away.
how much?
nothing you see here is for sale, mr gold.
oh, everything's for sale, everything.
you tell mr strong
i'm going to buy his yard.
this yard has been in his family since they settled.
but i've decided to make it part of our deal.
charlie?
charlie, come here.
i'm gonna spin a coin for your yard, charlie.
you're going to what?
if it's heads...
abbie here takes all of this with my blessing.
tommy?
and if it's tails...
i fuck your daughter, mr gold.
you have three daughters i hear, and esmeralda is the oldest and also the prettiest, so i'll have her.
so make her part of the deal and spin against the yard.
tommy, for fuck's sake.
here, you toss the coin, mr gold.
no.
please don't believe this is a joke, the coin to us is sacred, yes, arthur?
sacred.
you toss that coin, you take a bet before witnesses, and if i win...
then we'll insist that the terms of this agreement... wager are fulfilled.
toss the coin, mr gold.
tommy shelby, obe...
no wager today... but with this penny i will buy a flower to put on your grave...
when the time comes.
and before that time... please don't again disrespect my friends or their valued property.
we missed christmas, let's have it now.
peace on earth, goodwill to all men.
drink?
rum, curly?
toast to my brother, john, raise your glasses all of you.
raise them up, all of you.
john shelby.
i've got wire, i've got chains,
i've got the steel rods. now what?
right, put the steel rods up the geese's arse there, and then you put those steel rods above the fire, spinning the rod to stop the bird from burning.
cheers!
you did get potatoes, charlie?
no, i didn't get fucking potatoes, what's the matter with you?
i don't want that bastard aberama gold putting it around that we live like diddycoys.
i want him to see that we live proper, that we eat proper, in the proper way.
what the fuck are you talking about?
i'll get the potatoes meself.
never thought my high fucking heels from paris would be stepping through the horse shit of small heath ever again.
temporary, polly.
yeah, until hell freezes over.
how's michael?
you said eight men from new york, seven from sicily, at â£500 each?
course you can afford it.
most we'll do ourselves.
how many of your factories are in the safe territories?
seventy percent.
shelby company limited will continue to manufacture.
lizzie says its only whores these days?
yeah.
have them smuggled in, i suppose.
i need you back, polly.
paying whores for sex.
paying killers to kill.
yep, nothing for nothing.
poor thomas.
you know, our mother went this way.
spirits and ghosts, tablets, fucking... fucking sã©ances, scaring us kids halfway to fuckin' death.
yeah, well. i'm not going that way.
'cause in the smoke
i realised something.
i'm just like you now.
you and arthur.
i was dead in that noose and then i was saved, so everything from now on is extra.
but what i didn't understand until today is when you're dead already... you're free.
fucking love it.
i'll help you because
michael wants me to help you.
starting now...
get your whores vetted by lizzie, they'll use your weakness.
don't take any new men on in the factories unless you know their families.
and your new friend,
mr aberama gold... he wants something other than just money.
i see things in the air around people, but it's not just the tablets.
it's real.
ask him what he really wants.
she's a fine beast this one.
nothing you see is for sale, mr shelby.
you know your grandfather camped with mine for a while?
yep...
and didn't last.
no, it ended badly in a pub called the wenlock.
we were owed money, still are.
other than money, and this scrapyard that's clearly not for sale, what is it that you want from me, mr gold?
how do you know
i want anything from you?
well, because my company treasurer is a certified accountant and also apparently, a witch.
you're a sporting man.
- yes, i am.
- and a gambling man.
bonnie, take off your shirt.
what i want from you, mr shelby, is for you to take a gamble on him.
i want you to help my son achieve his ambition.
what ambition might that be?
who is it?
inspector moss.
- i'm looking for tommy.
- he's at charlie's.
but i wouldn't go there, some bad men have arrived.
yes, i've heard.
they'll be drunk by now, or worse.
can you take a message?
the, uh, intelligence service in london have sent seven officers up to birmingham to check out the investigation into communists and seditionists.
they've got a list of people of great interest and, uh, top of that list is
ada thorne, formerly shelby.
now, they seem to think that she came back from new york to organise a revolution in birmingham.
well, tell them they're wrong.
ada shelby's now firmly back in place in the family business.
thing is, when you get a mark against your name... it's very hard to shift it.
they will come looking for her.
well, tell them there's a queue.
everybody wants a shelby.
mrs shelby...
these are military men, no less dangerous than any italians.
you tell tommy,
i think he'll understand.
say goodnight to you then.
- hello, curly.
- oh, hello.
i'm here to collect mr shelby's horse. i'm a little early, i think.
are you going to train the horse to race?
yes.
don't use a crop, she's very gentle.
- i won't.
- yo.
i, i...
how is mr shelby?
well, now he's got the americans after him, he's a bit hard on people.
- the americans?
- yeah, they call them the mafia.
dear god.
yeah, there's 15 of them.
yeah, they want to kill us all, but we got guns and grenades and, and polly's back, so it's gonna be okay, yeah.
i'll get the horse.
mr shelby, thank god you're back, we've got real trouble.
what meetings do i have today?
um, well, uh, there's a supplier from coventry at 10:00, uh, the convener with the boiler makers unit at 11:00, and then chamber of commerce at 1:00.
but that isn't the thing...
right. clear a space here, move this car back, give me a hundred feet of rope and a bell.
- rope?
- yep, and a bell.
mr shelby, this place is about to explode.
a rope and a bell, devlin.
bonnie, this way.
yes, mr shelby.
and by the way, the revolution is scheduled to begin at noon.
there he is, billy mills, former heavyweight champion,
staffordshire, warwickshire and worcestershire.
hello, billy.
yeah.
and now i work for you, mr shelby, for not enough money.
right. that enough for you?
enough for what?
someone here who wants to fight you.
bonnie gold, come here, son.
i'm a heavyweight, he's a welterweight at best.
nevertheless, he wants to fight you.
yeah. and then when i damage him, the blinders will take my eyes.
no comeback, billy, just a fight, queensbury rules.
- when?
- now.
- where?
- here!
right, you lot, come here.
let's make it interesting.
come place a wager with me.
i'll give you good odds.
i'll give you good odds on the boy, even better on the big lad.
there you go, what you want?
bonnie, come here, son.
- give him one!
- let's have it then!
your boy knows he can hit back, right?
told him in the professional game people want their money's worth, don't win too fast.
but if you've seen enough...
finish it, bonnie.
fuck me. that was a punch.
what's he got, horseshoes in those gloves or what?
no, just his dad's strength and his mother's temper.
- does he have fits?
- no.
- asthma?
- no.
how's he cut?
well, no one's cut him yet, but his skin's thick.
- does he drink?
- water, sometimes.
- how many fights?
- twenty-five, bare knuckle, all knockouts, five with gloves in pastures, all knockouts.
against romany fighters?
that's why they won't let us in the fairs no more, he keeps winning.
i could fight a fucking tree and knock it out, mr shelby.
i like him. i like it.
- mrs eden is waiting upstairs
- i'll be there in a minute. arthur?
mr shelby's on his way.
fight in the workshop?
no, no, just a bit of sport.
do you want some more tea?
no, what kind of sport?
sport between men, mrs eden.
actually, i'm miss eden.
be patient, a good man will come.
- what do you think?
- no, that was over fast.
yeah, but you can tell, eh?
i'd give him to the irish boys at digbeth, they can teach him.
- and then what?
- we promote him.
big money in london,
new york, if he's good.
we control him.
on the book, control the odds, like a horse.
control when he wins, when he loses.
alfie solomon runs a fighter, says it's fuckin' money for nothing, fighting's been good for us, better if you know who's gonna win.
but we got a lot going on, that's all.
yeah. that's why it'd be good to have the kid around.
we take the fucking kid on, one day he may end up fucking taking a bullet for you.
can't afford to lose another brother, can i?
no one else is like him, so he's all right.
come on.
all right, i'll do it.
but we need to do a deal about money.
- hmm.
- yeah. speak to my accountant.
- the witch?
- yeah.
so when will my first real fight be do you think, mr shelby?
soon as we can find anyone stupid enough to get in the ring with you.
god help him.
there you go, bonnie.
you're a peaky blinder now, son.
- there you go, the lion's share.
- thank you.
mr shelby...
i understand you've had a bereavement.
i'm here to talk business.
then i'll be blunt.
as will i.
what you're doing here is robbery.
every man is free to leave.
you cut five shillings from the weekly wage.
and you said, if i did that you'd bring every man and woman in all my factories out on strike.
yes.
do you have a whistle?
if so, blow it.
i thought at least we might have a discussion, as i do with other owners.
i'm not other owners.
no.
you believe because coal is expensive and it's been a cold winter and because wages have been cut over the past twelve months, you think because of all that nobody will walk out on strike, because no one can afford to.
and until recently that would've been true.
but something has changed this past year.
cold winter in the east, people are not afraid anymore.
i have it on very good authority that the bolsheviks couldn't organise a fucking picnic.
you know, mr shelby...
it's almost as if you want trouble.
if the rule of law in birmingham were to break down during this period of turmoil for my family, then yes, that would indeed have its benefits for reasons you could not understand.
i've heard rumours.
sport between men.
just blow your fucking whistle, eh?
tools down, we've had a clearing!
right, come on you lot, put your tools down!
everyone out!
i said, everyone out.
stop working immediately.
yeah, come in.
i did say this would happen.
who's next?
um, he's a, a delegate from the european council for trade.
he's here to talk about the import of car parts to france.
- right.
- he's come all the way from paris, but given the circumstances
i could send him away?
given what circumstances? send him in.
mr shelby, this is
monsieur paz from paris.
i heard you had trouble.
it's good of you to see me.
you just came from paris, eh?
you know paris?
i left paris in a cattle truck.
they said you were french.
well, i came here from paris.
that does not mean i'm french.
guess where i'm from.
well, in my cattle truck in paris...
there were american soldiers who played cards.
they sound like you.
yeah. did you win?
you didn't come on a train. your suit is pressed, your shoes are clean.
where do you get your suits made?
i have a tailor in new york city.
look.
funacci, italian.
he's my uncle.
he makes suits in the basement of madge street.
he is my uncle, so every stitch, stitched with blood.
i heard you dress well, mr shelby, but now i see... not so well as me.
you know, i have uncles as well...
but they're not the sort of men who would, who would work in a basement with a needle and thread,
mr changretta.
i am surprised how easy it was to get into a room with you.
and now?
and now?
and now you should know that during the trouble you had earlier on your factory floor
i sent an accomplice into your office in overalls.
he found your gun... and unloaded it.
arthur shelby.
polly gray.
michael gray.
john shelby.
spent.
ada thorne.
and finally...
tommy shelby.
none of you will survive.
you're level of security is pitiful and we are an organisation of a different dimension.
i could've killed you when
i walked through the door.
but you see...
i want you to be the last.
i want you to be alive after your entire family is dead
'cause my mother says that is what will hurt you the most.
you people have traditions of honour, as do we.
instead of sending you a black hand,
i could've had you killed in the night.
i don't know why...
but i want you to know why and i wanna suggest to you that we fight this vendetta with honour.
no civilians, no children.
no police.
welcome to birmingham, mr changretta.
<i>grazie.</i>
<i># where the road is dark</i>
<i># and the seed is sown
where the gun is cocked... #</i>
ah, that smell. i miss it.
what, the shithouse?
no. i don't know what it is.
birmingham, i suppose. small heath.
- that smell.
- the smell brings it back.
where'sjohn do you think, tom?
fuck knows.
well, he's gone, though.
like a hole behind your head.
thought you thought there was are heaven.
no. more like hell for ourjohn.
no, neither one.
he's just not here anymore.
<i># now i been out in the desert</i>
<i># just doin' my time</i>
<i># searchin' through the dust</i>
<i># lookin' for a sign</i>
<i># if there's a light up ahead... #</i>
it's like with grace, arthur...
they're just gone, just fucking gone.
<i># i got this fever burnin ' in my soul #</i>
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man #</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand #</i>
i want you to be alive after your entire family is dead.
that is what will hurt you the most.
<i>michael is badly wounded.
john is dead.</i>
<i>i sent a message to aberama gold.</i>
<i>i need you back.</i>
<i>i'll help you
'cause michael wants me to help you.</i>
starting now.
<i>the bullet's been written.</i>
me, as the oldest brother, will put this bullet into his head.
you said you'd bring every man and woman out on strike.
do you have a whistle?
<i>it's almost as if you want trouble.</i>
all right, first come, first served.
form an orderly line, all of you.
all right. all right.
right!
have your contracts of employment in your hand!
bring 'em in. get in there.
get moving.
on you go. go on.
keep going. keep going.
you, where are you going?
- bradley. foreman.
- all right.
you go and see that man over there. go.
- what's your name?
- bradley. i'm the foreman.
- when did you last work here?
how many have done this type of work before?
they're mostly farm hands from down worcester way.
but i'll show 'em.
hungry men learn fast.
all right. on you go.
dirty scabs! black legs!
what bastard threw that?
get him out here!
bring him out!
it wasn't me!
arthur!
oi! enough.
come on. get him out. get out!
get out!
all right, ten more.
two more.
- that's it.
- ten.
close it up.
right. ten bob a man.
two pound there for you.
what about security?
yeah, well about that.
by order of the city of birmingham police department, you and your ugly workforce are now under the protection of the peaky fucking blinders.
- mr gray?
- yeah, send him in.
it's your mother.
oh, fuck.
i read about it in the paper.
i have a right.
i'm your mum as well.
you want me to go away?
yes.
i'll just leave these.
they're from our orchard.
you used to love these.
i hope there are no worms in them.
look,
i just wanted to say that you're welcome to come home.
to get better at home.
i know you got bored in the village but... we love you.
and your little brother misses playing football with you.
and your dad... passed on.
he passed on peacefully in our bed.
oh, fuck.
now go home.
i'm expecting tommy.
he's due here now.
i'll go then.
i'll not be in the same room as that man.
come on, poll, tommy's expecting us.
who's with us?
isiah and two lee boys.
ada? how long since you've had a fuck?
what?
been nearly two years with me.
over christmas, i counted it up.
so i've made a new year's resolution to change the situation.
oh. anyone particular in mind?
not really.
just me and someone unsuitable.
<i># from starry eyes colliding</i>
<i># from mars to someone crying</i>
i'll sit in the front.
<i># no matter what i'm hiding</i>
<i># i get lost</i>
<i># but i always come around</i>
<i># call when you're ready
'cause i'm ready to ride #</i>
so this is just to make business official.
your official return to the company payroll.
so no more talk of new year's resolutions or tommy might change his mind.
what new year's resolutions?
never mind.
i think ada's trying to tell me to behave myself.
yeah. behave yourself.
behave myself or what?
behave myself or fucking what?
okay polly, i'll tell you the truth.
after your recent troubles,
tommy asked me to keep an eye on you.
troubles?
whilst working for this company
i have killed a man,
i have lost a man, i have found a son,
i have nearly lost a son,
i have nearly lost my own life.
now i will accept my job back if the terms on offer are favourable.
but i will not behave myself.
sorry i'm late.
where's arthur?
do i look like his fucking mother?
no, linda.
why are you here?
you all right? is billy all right?
yes. everything's fine.
well look, lovely to see you, but i'm late for a meeting.
they can wait.
i've got something for you.
something for a loving husband who's been working very hard and is under a great deal of pressure.
something to relieve his stress
oh.
it's silk. from japan.
feel.
my hands are dirty.
good.
feel all of it.
feel it properly.
you, uh, you want to do this here?
why not? i thought you were the boss.
i am the fucking boss.
so tell me what to do, boss.
come here.
right.
before we start this extraordinary general meeting of the board of the shelby company limited,
i'd like to note the absence of the deputy vice president who has not yet arrived.
we will continue without his presence.
item number one.
the reinstatement of the shelby company limited
company treasurer.
the board welcomes back the former treasurer, with generously improved terms and conditions.
due to the exceptionally difficult circumstances the company now finds itself in.
the proposed treasurer will now check the terms and conditions to see if they are in order.
item number two.
during the absence of the
company accountant, due to ill health, all responsibility for the keeping of company accounts pass to the head of acquisitions.
item number three.
the company treasurer, having read the terms and condition, lodges a signed contract of employment agreeing to the terms and conditions with the temporary head of accounts.
all those in favour of the reinstatement of mrs elizabeth gray, to the position of shelby company
limited company treasurer, please raise your hands.
why goodness, thank you.
any other business?
right. i declare this extraordinary general meeting over.
now we can talk about the real business.
but for that we need arthur.
where the fuck is arthur?
- mr shelby...
- fuck off.
- they've broken into the paint shop.
- oh, yeah?
they're chucking paint around.
i think they mean to set light to it.
well, you deal with it, man.
i'm fucking busy!
what was all that about?
in this sinful place there will be temptations.
it's my responsibility as your wife to help you resist those temptations.
by putting myself between you... and the devil.
in the words of my sinful catholic mother,
"keep his balls empty and his belly full."
god rest her soul.
mr shelby...
you have to come to the paint shop immediately. please.
i have to go.
won't be late.
sorry, ladies, there's no smoking in here.
yes, love, we know.
all right, he's an hour late.
fuck him.
this business directly affects arthur, but he's not here, so we'll take a vote without him.
what business?
official business that wasn't on your agenda, ada.
an informant told us that six years ago, luca changretta came from new york to birmingham to be best man at his cousin's wedding.
we found out that they used
reid and dunn on broadgate for the photographs.
the photographer kept the negatives.
i persuaded him to give us copies.
and to enlarge this one.
that is luca changretta.
i've seen his face, so i could pick him out.
half the men in the photograph are changrettas, which means the chances are they are the men who come to kill us.
we need to get both these photographs into pubs and on street corners.
then we put it about that there's a reward for information.
we also propose that we give a copy of this photograph to mr aberama gold.
we need to forget the idea that it has to be arthur that pulls the trigger.
tradition will just fuck us up.
we should wait for arthur.
arthur's not here, ada.
we need luca changretta dead. that's it.
dropping the law of the bullet is part of the process of modernisation that i was working on before i...
before i was executed.
you weren't executed, poll.
what did you call me?
right. let's take a vote.
i'll deal with arthur.
all those in favour of giving the photographs to mr gold, raise your hand.
then it will be done.
- mum...
- oh, "mum" now, is it?
i smelt perfume when i came in here.
yeah, it was the flowers.
right, that's it.
who came in here, michael?
the truth is, polly, the woman that raised him came in here.
she has every right to come in here.
she brought him fucking apples and she left.
we are in the middle of a vendetta and arthur is missing.
we need to find him.
concentrate on what unites us.
- this is all temporary.
- yeah, temporary. right.
<i># there's a devil inside of me</i>
<i># he's holding on... #</i>
bastards!
<i># and i don't know if he's staying</i>
<i># or for how long</i>
<i># there's a devil inside of me.</i>
<i># and he's holding on</i>
<i># and i don't know if he's staying or for how long... #</i>
party is it, eh?
is that what it is?
what is this, a party, eh?
fuck off out of it! get out!
<i># and i'm sad to say he's got me thinking</i>
<i># about the bad parts of my life...</i>
okay, i wasn't gonna hit ya.
but that wasn't fucking nice.
<i># there's a devil inside of me
a monolith of doom</i>
oh, you...
arthur... mr shelby, please.
- please.
- don't fucking move.
- eh?
- mr shelby, please, please, please.
now get the fuck out!
fuck your fuckin' revolution!
<i># i find i'm right back at the start #</i>
i'm a fucking mess.
shh.
where are you going?
come here.
fucking hit man, are you?
eh? is that what you are?
arthur shelby, eh?
let's see who wanted you.
what about...
what about fucking john shelby?
huh?
john.
thank you.
send my guests in.
you wire polo and let him tell the family.
he has four kids.
don't you two have any other clothes to wear?
huh?
look at me.
huh?
i'm here as a lover of theatre.
they kill two of our men...
you complain about your fucking belly.
luca.
luca.
- with respect.
- "with respect"?
you raised...
"with respect"?
open your mouth.
- come on...
- open your fucking mouth!
you fucking dress like them.
you eat like them.
you don't fucking talk to me about, "with respect".
sit down.
what do you have?
arthur shelby killed her son in a boxing ring four years ago.
she would do that for us?
okay.
okay.
anyone seen arthur?
anyone seen arthur? eh?
in your office, tom.
if you're not going to show up for a family meeting, let someone know.
we thought you were dead.
there's 15 fucking italians out there.
no there's not, there's 13.
i just killed two of them.
ripped out their hearts and burnt their bones to ash.
i did it.
me.
your brother.
not fucking aberama gold or his punch drunk son.
but me.
even if you don't trust me no more.
what the fuck are you talking about?
arthur?
i got cleaned up at ada's.
she told me.
you took a vote in my absence.
all right, calm down and tell me about the men you killed.
you put my job out for contract.
arthur...
yeah, well, i'm gonna make it my fucking job anyway.
because this was all my fault.
it was me that shot the old man.
- yeah, out of mercy.
- aye.
nowjohn's dead.
he's dead because of me and i'm gonna make it right.
arthur, wait.
how did the men get in the factory?
i need to know.
through the back fucking door that was supposed to be locked and bolted.
some bastard gave me up.
somebody with keys.
yeah. why don't you sit down and work it out for yourself.
take a fucking vote.
who is this little bear?
yes. eh?
are you all right?
daddy's home, isn't he?
yeah, i'm all right.
look, daddy's home.
how's polly?
is she all right?
oh, go on, linda.
i mean, it was her idea, wasn't it? hmm?
the japanese silk? hmm?
i'll put him to bed.
you kept me away from that fucking meeting to stop me from voting.
- here we go.
- it was polly's idea, wasn't it?
eh?
you know what i am, don't ya?
i'm a working man. yeah.
fucking working man.
fucking...
who's lost his job.
is that what i am, linda?
is that what i am, eh?
i don't want you dead.
polly doesn't want you dead.
let mr gold do the killing for money.
it's the modern way, arthur.
watch.
hmm? hmm?
what are you doing?
now fire it into the fireplace.
please.
- all right.
- fire it.
get rid of it.
then we'll go to bed.
we'll do anything you like.
just fire the gun, arthur.
fire it.
ah!
you go tell polly... there are rules between a man and woman.
there are rules.
that i have to do this.
i have to do it.
john wants me to do it, linda.
my brother...
and i'm gonna do it!
was it fear or was it hatred?
was what fear or hatred?
isiah...
you had a one way ticket to glasgow in your pocket.
your wife and kids left three days ago.
now, i'm gonna ask you again.
was it fear of the italians or hatred of us that made you unlock the door and give up my brother?
i didn't unlock any door.
here, have a drink.
you're gonna need it.
thirty five drumcree street,
parkhead, glasgow...
please, please, please, please...
we have allegiances with catholic gangs in that city.
your family are safe only at my discretion.
now, explain to me why you were catching the midnight train to glasgow.
you mean you don't know?
i run a factory full of black leg non-union labour.
i live in a street full of men laid off or on strike.
look at the photograph, mr devlin, and tell me who are the men
- that contacted you.
- no.
no, you listen to me.
i get spat at, windows smashed, petrol on the curtains.
but for fear of you
i clock in every fucking morning.
and today, two men are shot and burnt on my shift.
and you ask me why i'm getting on the midnight train to glasgow.
who else has the keys to that door?
they hang on a hook inside my office.
today i left the office unlocked.
- why?
- because i forgot.
because i left in a hurry.
because there were men trying to set fire to the factory.
mr shelby, may i tell you something?
you have a lot of enemies.
communists. italians.
before the factory came out on strike,
i heard word that two italians attended a communist party meeting in stechford.
they hardly spoke english.
now, if they got a party man into the factory, it might have been him that unlocked the door for them.
mr shelby, my train leaves at 12:00.
it's just gone 11:00.
i can still make it.
please. for my kids.
i need you here.
isiah, get three of our men with police badges to watch mr devlin's house.
mr shelby, please...
our friends in glasgow will take care of your family.
for the curtains.
before you, i was an ordinary working man.
yeah, and now you're one of us.
<i># blackbird, blackbird
singing the blues all day</i>
<i># right outside of my door... #</i>
- who is it?
- tommy shelby.
- is this union business?
- yes.
so conduct it in the proper place at the proper time.
i've come to make an improved offer.
i heard music.
what's your improved offer?
- do i not get a drink?
- no.
have you ever seen any of the men in this photograph before?
what?
you're a member of the stechford communist party.
i'm told two italian men attended a meeting recently.
can you see either of the men in this picture?
as the small heath coordinator of the organisation for the maintenance of supplies
i have also been sworn in as a special...
we have reason to believe that outside agitators from overseas are attempting to foment trouble in our factories in advance of a general strike which could take place at any moment.
this is a matter of national security.
may i look at your badge?
yes.
what would you like to drink, constable?
whisky.
and, actually, it's sergeant.
i only have beer. times are hard.
how long has it been since you've had a bottle of m&b bitter?
help yourself.
have a seat.
you know, when this business began,
i did some research on you.
it turns out i know someone who used to know you very well.
kittyjurossi.
you were in love with kitty's sister.
greta jurossi. before the war.
do you remember greta jurossi?
her parents were italian.
they didn't approve of a watery lane
gypsy, but you won them over.
with your charm. sweetness.
very, very thorough research.
greta died at the age of 19.
of consumption.
and kitty said you were at her bedside for three months.
every day, holding her hand.
and after she died you went away to war.
kitty said that the sweet boy who left never came back.
no one came back.
here's the funniest thing.
she said in those days you believed in things.
in justice. fairness.
once you saw a man beating his horse and you fought him.
he was twice your size but you beat him.
and then you beat him with his own whip.
kitty always liked to tell tall tales.
she's a party member now.
she swears before you enlisted in the army you joined the communist party yourself.
is that true?
you know, when i was at the door,
i saw you through the curtains.
you were dancing alone.
i've also done my research.
your sweetheart was at passchendaele.
when he came back, he was listed among the shell shocked.
blew his own fucking brains out.
i don't know any men in the photo.
you haven't looked.
this afternoon two men came into my factory and tried to kill my brother.
i believe a stechford communist party member let him in.
i was wondering if you might be able to help me in my investigations.
kitty said next time i see you, before we start fighting,
i should send you her love from the good old days and give you this.
greta jurossi and tommy shelby in blackpool.
do you recognise the boy in the photograph?
i'll leave that here.
apologies for interrupting your dance.
<i># i wish</i>
<i># i wait</i>

arthur... i need you to listen to me.
i need you to listen to me, arthur...
the world is changing.
listen to me, arthur.
and listen to the sweet voice ofjesus...
<i># i wish... #</i>
- finn?
- it came from arthur's house.
arthur.
arthur.
where is he?
arthur.
he fired the bullet.
linda...
said it's the modern way, tom...
it's the modern way.
yeah. yeah.
yeah, it's all right.
it's all right, brother.
you did well.
god spoke to him, not me.
what are you doing here?
on mondays, i do the inventory.
make sure nobody's dipping their hand.
well, it's my job now.
i'm back.
and there's gonna be nobody dipping their hand with me here, not unless they want it cut off.
i said to arthur while i'm stuck in this fucking place
i want something to keep my mind busy.
what? you're going to take bets?
i have always been able to do addition and subtraction without pen and paper.
but i'll need a telephone.
apparently we have special clients who take bets by telephone.
linda?
this is a betting shop.
look.
arthur said yes. tommy said yes.
but did god say yes?
gambling is a sin, linda.
it's not me that's doing the gambling.
i'm just taking the bets.
the rule is that door should always remain locked until 9:00 a. m.
right. boy. boy, where are you going?
well, arthur's not coming in today.
he's taking the day off. so...
so what?
so today, tommy said that i'm in charge.
sorry, you're in charge?
yeah. that's what he said.
all right, sweetheart.
ladies?
let's give our boss a first day that he'll never forget.
sending finn to the shop was a mistake.
they've already found out he's a virgin and they're arranging a girl for him, this afternoon.
i thought linda was there.
she is. she loved the idea.
i know. she even swears now.
"fuck".
sounds funny coming from her.
polly says in the end we all turn into our mother.
well, keep an eye on her.
hmm.
the whore watching the madonna.
does finn know what they have planned?
no.
do they have someone?
yes. a girl i used to work with.
- is she nice?
- no.
she's from aston.
they're paying her out of petty cash.
right, well, call 'em and tell them to pay extra and get someone nice.
nice women don't do that sort of thing.
yes, they do. what about you?
i mean in the past. come on.
where are we going?
somewhere i've not been in a long time.
are we expecting somebody?
tommy, i'm fucking freezing here.
we used to come here.
she'd wait for hours for me, when i couldn't make it.
and i'd wait for her if her family kept her in.
who?
some girl.
some girl before france.
i've not been back here since.
but i wanted to come here with you.
are you kissing her or me?
you.
i want shelby company limited to increase non-taxable charitable contributions to local charities by twenty-five percent as of now.
and i'm gonna build two new institutes for destitute children.
one in saltley, one in digbeth.
i've already identified the buildings.
two former workhouses.
i want you to be in charge of the project.
all right, come on, let's go.
why?
because i promised someone
i'd change the world.
you do realise, tommy, we're all going fucking mad here.
yeah, i know.
come on.
finn? come here.
- how was your day?
- yeah, it was okay.
good man. well done.
no trouble?
no. no trouble.
and she looked after you?
i don't want it like that ever again, tom.
not when they don't even want to do it, except for the money.
everything's for the money, finn.
yeah, i know. but...
she said, "be a man."
and were you a man?
yeah.
but then i apologised to her.
because she looked so tired.
sit down, finn.
right, listen to me, finn.
she was right.
you need to be a fucking man.
people get tired.
working in a fucking factory gets you tired.
i don't go round apologising.
do i?
no.
there's an empty space here to be filled.
do you understand?
- yeah.
- so...
be a fucking man.
okay, tom.
- champagne, please.
- of course.
madam...
women alone are not allowed at the bar.
will someone be joining you?
what do you think?
this is public enough, no?
yes.
so?
the boy in the hospital is out of bounds.
and i will ask you to spare finn and arthur.
in return for what?
tommy shelby.
and, uh, why should i trust you?
because you know our history.
you know what happened between us.
you are an unlikely cassius.
mmm...
you know, my mother...
my mother knew your mother.
she taught her how to read.
did she tell you that john and arthur spared her life?
when tommy wanted her dead.
yeah.
and now she's given me the information about you people.
so tommy shelby was right.
his, uh, ruthlessness was justified.
you should have killed her when you had the chance.
john was a good boy.
arthur tries.
tommy's different.
you take tommy.
spare the rest.
you know, my mother used to say this about you.
she said,
"that polly gray,
"that child would never let go of a grievance."
and she loves to dance.
what do you say, huh?
you want to dance?
i don't dance any more.
well, that's a shame.
'cause you're dancing with me.
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>

<i>some girl before france.</i>
what is it that you want from me, mr gold?
<i>i want you to help my son achieve his ambition.</i>
- what do you have?
- we found another enemy.
arthur shelby killed her son in a boxing ring four years ago.

i just killed two of them.</i>
<i>the boy in the hospital is out of bounds.</i>

in return for what?
tommy shelby.
tom.
good morning, mrs ross.
have a seat.
thank you for seeing me, mr shelby.
i know how busy you are.
how can i help you?
well, you see, tomorrow would have been my son's 21st birthday.
had he lived.
and i'm having a bit of a thing.
just sandwiches and beer and looking at old photos.
and, as a gesture,
i thought i would invite your brother, arthur.
a gesture of what, mrs ross?
not exactly forgiveness.
but something like that.
and also it's a way of saying thank you to the shelby family for helping me and my children get by since the death of my edward.
that's very kind of you.
that's very kind.
well, i will let arthur know.
it'll be at my house at midday.
he should come at midday.
your house, midday tomorrow.
all right.
one of us will be there.
it ought to be arthur.
goodbye, mrs ross.
<i># yay, you keep it slow</i>
<i># yayyay, you keep it low</i>
<i># you cast a spell that keeps me wired</i>
<i># keeps me red, you keep me on fire</i>
<i># so why do you take me down, down to nothing</i>
<i># always out cold, never been higher #</i>
all right, at midday today,
arthur will be here.
47, artillery square.
like a goat tied up for the fucking tiger, eh, arthur?
yeah, right.
dear lord, forgive me.
but vengeance is forthcoming and long overdue.
right. there are two ways into artillery square.
one here, the tow path, and here, navigation street.
finn, take a rifle.
you'll be here, finn, covering the tow path.
most likely, they'll come down
navigation street.
johnny and isiah will set up here as hawkers selling stolen pork.
when you get the signal from me, then you can open fire.
- from you, eh?
- yep, i will be here, in a window, overlooking.
you still know what end the bullets come out of, tom?
he knows.
these men are coming for my brother, believing him to be unarmed and unprotected.
so this is my fucking business.
arthur, let's go.
look alive, soldier.
just put them on the table.
buy yourself bacon here!
ribs, cheek and tongue.
and your trotter.
ribs, tongue and cheek. huh?
mr shelby.
- i'm glad you could come.
- yeah, well...
thank you for the invitation.
so...
i don't allow firearms in the house.
it's a good thing i'm not carrying a firearm then, ain't it, mrs ross?
do you mind if i check?
no.
come in.
take a seat.
would you like some tea while we wait, mr shelby?
what are we waiting for?
the other guests.
at threepence for the four. huh?
pig's blood, penny a gallon, pig's blood.
so, where are these other guests?
they will be here very soon.
but in the meantime, there are some things i want to say.
before they get here.
by all means.
i've heard stories that you have welcomed jesus into your life.
i have indeed.
at the beseeching of your wife, who they say is a good woman.
she is my shining light.
though her mother, by all accounts, was not.
do you think your repentance will mean you are forgiven of your sins?
we both know that forgiveness is out of my hands.
i mean, for murdering my son.
that was a sporting accident.
because i have not yet found it in my heart to forgive you.
and don't think i ever will.
well, then why have you invited me here today?
hmm?
off you go now.
why am i here, mrs ross?
why did you invite me here today?
too late to back out now.
now, johnny, fire!
it's a fucking decoy!
bring the car round, now!
what are you doing?
oh, shit!
arthur!
arthur, they're not here for you.
it must be michael.
you fucking slag!
you set me up, eh?
you set me up!
unarmed.
arthur, you need to get to the hospital now!
fuck off!
if your faith is real,
i've got other kids.
if you're here in one hour,
i swear to god,
i will cover you in tar and fucking feathers.
c'mon, finn, let's go.
uh-uh-uh.
where i'm from, a hat on the bed is unlucky.
my family say it brings doubt.
maybe... maybe that's what happened.
last time my man was sent for you, you got lucky.
now...
your luck's run out.
and tell your mother we have a deal.
come here!
michael? what happened, eh?
what happened?
they heard you, er...
they heard you coming.
the gun misfired.
they ran away.
johnny!
you came just in time.
you all right? you hurt?
i'm fine. i'm fine.
oi... get out!
small heath, 333.
charlie.
listen, bonnie gold will be calling you in four minutes.
tell him the italians are on the road south.
a rolls-royce, maybe two. black.
tell him to expect a full complement of men.
we inflicted no casualties.
i said we inflicted no fucking casualties.
there's been an accident.
why don't you move it out of the way?
what?
i said, why don't you clear it so that we can get past.
what's that accent?
we're americans.
we're here on business, so...
well, you're going to have to wait.
jesus christ, this guy.
we waited for you fucking yanks until 1918.
it'll be clear in 20 minutes, all right?
yeah, all right. thank you, officer.
thank fucking hell.
talking about the war.
everything here is about the war.
right, come on, let's go move it ourselves.
fucking idiots.
what's this?
whose wagon is that?
they're gypsies.
a tribe of fucking gypsies.
- well, we can move it...
- oi!
i said it'll be clear in 20 minutes.
let's go.
we'll find another way out of here.
go. get us the fuck out of here.
come on, fucking move!
make a fucking move!
put the guns down!
put the guns down!
<i>he spared me.</i>
he said, "tell your mum that we have a deal."
what deal?
just be you and me going to australia, michael.
- think about that.
- what deal, mum?
what deal did you make with luca changretta?
a deal to spare your life
in return for what?
men don't have the strategic intelligence to conduct a war between families.
men are less good at keeping secrets out of their lies.
you agreed to give up tommy to save my life.
you never forgave him, did you?
we're out of our league.
no.
- no, we don't do that to our own.
- think!
if it wasn't for me, you'd be smoke blowing out of a mortuary chimney.
think about that.
nah, two.
we killed two.
you also shot a copper.
shot in the arm, with purpose.
there's a copper on the floor, the stratford constabulary will swarm all over it.
the copper's alive, got a description of the italians.
the italians will be forced underground.
we're gypsies.
we're already underground.
you yourself inflicted no casualties this end, so...
you know, mr shelby, maybe you've been pushing pieces of paper around too long.
luca changretta got away.
you let him get away.
when our paths cross,
i won't be so careless.
and when will your paths cross?
soon.
if her majesty smells of paraffin, it's because my old lamp is smoking for want of fuel.
times are hard, in case you hadn't noticed.
i hope your insistence that i take a boat rather than a cab from the station wasn't purely for your own amusement.
no. for the avoidance of death or kidnap.
and by boat, you get to see the nicer parts of a city.
you're in the garrison now, so you'll be all right.
this way.
good morning, lady carleton.
i'm not a lady.
too right you're not.
for shoeing, stabling, feed, and two hours a day in the gallops.
did you think of a name?
yes. "dangerous."
dangerous, eh?
a horse called dangerous won the epsom derby in 1833, so i stole the name.
i thought you'd approve.
you should visit her.
if i leave small heath,
i'll be shot dead.
anyway, i'm busy.
well, the good news is, your horse is the fastest filly that i've ever ridden.
these are her registration papers.
ready for your signature.
so is this why you came here?
all this way, in person?
for my fucking signature?
you've lost your wife, and now your brother too.
i thought it would make you different, but it doesn't seem to change you.
nothing seems to change you.
the end-of-year accounts for the
grace shelby institute, mr shelby.
beg your pardon, madam.
i've already signed off on those, lizzie.
what do you think of his shirt?
he's having them made in london.
i'm not sure about them.
all right, lizzie, thank you.
but you know, sometimes he sees something glamorous and expensive, he just can't resist it.
he's so weak.
actually, speaking of the
grace shelby foundation,
i'd like to make a donation.
i'll leave it blank.
you can decide how much, mr shelby.
then perhaps... lizzie?
...can pop to the bank and pay it in for me.
that'll be all, lizzie, thank you.
drink?
no, thank you.
did you pack an overnight bag?
no.
pity.
why?
well, because 25 minutes ago, the birmingham branch of the train drivers' union called a wildcat strike in support of the coal miners.
no trains to london until tomorrow.
it wasn't in any of the papers.
that's why they call it a wildcat.
no one knows.
apart from you, of course.
your city.
so where will i stay in your city?
i'll be free at 4:00.
i could meet you then.
meet and do what?
i will pour you some gin that i make myself, from my father's recipe.
distilled for the eradication of seemingly incurable sadness.
i'm going to put that on the label.
i'll book myself a room.
already done. the midland. suite.
i stay there myself sometimes.
sometimes, it's where you stay.
but not tonight, it would seem.
well, since i'm stuck here, maybe i should try your gin.
- 4:00 then.
- where?
i'll find you.
what the fuck was that about, lizzie? eh?
have a guess.
you know what,
i can't even guess any more.
i'll be back at 4:00.
why is she still here?
something to do with the coal miners, apparently.
oh, today's your lucky day, sir.
give you 3-1 on raging robbers.
come on, gents, get your bets on...
small heath, 552.
mrs gray.
i wanted to illustrate to you that at any time, we can reach your son.
and we will kill your son if you cannot deliver tommy shelby as you promised. huh?
you just tell us where and when.
<i>and we'll do the rest.</i>
where is he?
fucking.
- fucking what?
- fucking her.
ten thousand pounds?
she left it blank, so i filled it in for her.
what's tommy's diary looking like for the rest of the week?
fuck tommy and his cock and his gin.
and his stuck-up whore.
i saved this.
read my leaves, poll.
you haven't done my leaves in ages.
i haven't done anyone's leaves for ages.
okay.
pour.
swirl the teacup.
think about the man you love.
fuck him.
think about your white wedding gown.
now pour the tea back into the pot.
okay, i'll read your tea leaves if you go and get tommy's diary.
see if tommy's got a free afternoon in the next seven days.
friday.
now, read my future and make it fucking good.
make sure he keeps it free.
- just read my leaves, poll.
- already have.
plain as day.
what are you doing?
stop drinking whisky. switch to stout.
why?
make sure tommy keeps that friday free.
tell him i have an appointment for him.
and then go and see a doctor about that baby in your tea leaves.
next.
you're not at the fucking fairground now, son.
get down and skip me 200 for taking the piss out of a fine fighter.
he's got a head on him, that boy.
and a fist.
so what do you say, mr maine?
he works hard. he's game.
i'll need to work on his defence.
right now, his left hand is just good for wanking
you don't have to earn your money.
we're paying you anyway. is he ready?
is he even registered?
i put him down as a welterweight,
midlands division.
amateur turning pro.
just need your counter signature.
what?
like i'm going to say no to you boys?
just tell us, is he ready?
in 30 years, i've never seen a raw boy so ready.
that's 200, mr maine.
so who am i fighting first, mr shelby?
when you step in the ring, bonnie, who do you see across the canvas, eh?
i see myself.
forty years old having done fuck all, except tramping the lanes.
i see my life wasted.
i won't let it happen.
me, i'm going to be a champion.
fight out at camden town.
boy's name is goliath.
he said he's at a meeting.
yes, i was wondering, do you have any boots that i could borrow?
why do you need boots?
well, no one here will speak to me, so i thought i'd take a walk by the canal.
is he really making gin?
he's going mad cooped up here is what he is.
like a wasp in a beer glass.
ma'am.
you'll look a bit funny in these, i think.
- oh.
- thank you, curly.
if you're going to take a walk along the canal, you'll also need this.
are you serious?
italians north, italians south.
he makes gin to take his mind off being stuck inside a prison.
if you had any sense, mrs carleton, you'd get out of here now.
curly can sail you to snow hill station hidden in the coal sacks.
i said i would wait.
the man you're waiting for doesn't exist.
while you're waiting for the man who doesn't exist, would you like to try some of his gin?
<i>the strikers blocked the coventry road,</i>
<i>made all the men get off the buses.</i>
where were the police?
they were busy.
apparently, there was a report of armed men in the small heath area.
and there was a murder at the summer lane hospital.
and something happening on the stratford road.
the strikers threatened the men's families.
they said, come the revolution, their names would be on a list.
like in russia.
and the buses turned round?
yes. they turned round.
mr shelby, factories are shut, mines are shut, coal's running out.
did you ever consider the possibility that the communists might win?
and you and me, traitors to our class, will be put up against a wall and shot.
as a businessman,
i consider all possibilities.
but mr devlin,
i'm not a traitor to my class.
small heath, 551.
i am just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.
hello, ada, it's me.
i need your help.
<i># hole in her sock where her toe poked through #</i>
it's 4:00.
is it?
what do you think?
er, nice. a little sweet.
i've heard not sweet enough.
come and see.
my god, tommy.
what is this, a hobby?
no. i don't really have time for hobbies.
this is more of a...
more of a place where i try things out.
i've decided, if i'm gonna be stuck here in small heath,
i might as well do something useful.
less of a hobby.
more of a venture.
since the start of prohibition,
i've been sending single malt scotch whisky to boston, to halifax, nova scotia, hidden in crates of car parts.
but my supply lines from scotland have been unreliable.
there's been a lot of thefts.
and in this modern age, american women drink as much booze as the men.
and women, apparently, prefer gin.
so with the help of a friend of mine in camden town,
i've set up my own source of supply.
junipers, potatoes, sugar and water, all turned into us dollars.
when we're up and running, we'll produce over 200 gallons a week.
but before then,
i need to get my recipe right.
so tell me the truth.
- the truth?
- mmm-hmm.
you're unlike any man i've ever met.
- and the gin?
- too sweet.
you said you'd booked a room.
no, i booked a suite.
thank you.
if you book a taxi, i'll go.
you're a businessman, tommy.
a good one.
- if only you could...
- if only i could what?
if only you could change?
go on, say it.
if only you could change the bad.
and "the good" is laying off a thousand men, which i do.
like a good businessman, and i do it like that.
and people go hungry.
and the bad, the bad's a fucking win on the horses and a gun and some fucking self-respect.
you fucking people...
you bite like your horse.
i don't trust taxis any more.
come with me.
there we go, brother.
home sweet home.
a place for you to bring women back, bring your mates.
play games, gamble, cards, and you keep an eye on our backyard.
it's artillery square, the place is full of communists and strikers.
having a shelby round here will keep them in order.
light the fucking fire.
take some of this shit off the walls.
curly'll be over later with some poison for the rats.
- arthur?
- huh?
this morning, i wouldn't have been able to pull that trigger.
i know i wouldn't.
they would have just walked past.
i'm notjohn.
- i know i'm not.
- all right.
all right, brother.
i know you're not.
i know.
in the end, it's god who pulls that fucking trigger anyway.
we don't get to decide who lives and who dies, finn.
not us.
you just have to flick a switch in your head.
charlie said it wasn't safe to walk by the canal.
and he's right.
italians north and south, he said.
no, it's mostly chancers.
local kids trying to get famous.
sabini's boys. sheffield boys.
manchester, glasgow.
they all know we're on the ropes.
- and that's not including the mafia.
- yup.
here's your carriage.
you can catch the 7:15 train.
i thought there was a strike.
what gave you that idea?
my god.
i know.
the bad i can't help.
i wanted you to stay.
and normally, i get my own way.
losing occasionally makes me worse.
thank you, curly.
she looks a picture in my boots, doesn't she, tom?
- walk her to the train, curly.
- yeah.
<i>"not a minute on the day, not a penny off the pay."</i>
this talk of national austerity, this talk of tightening our belts must be met with a resolute certainty.
we will not accept any cuts in pay.
we will not accept working longer hours for the same wage.
shoulder to shoulder with the coal miners, dock workers, railway men and steel workers, we will stand united through the storm that is surely coming to our city!
- jessie eden?
- yes?
i'd like to buy you a drink.
i'm afraid the pubs round here don't allow unaccompanied female drinkers.
i'm sure we'll be fine.
i know you from somewhere.
i'm ada thorne.
formerly shelby.
i have a settlement proposition that my brother's too arrogant and proud to offer you in person.
sorry, ladies, we don't...
don't what?
it's all right. i'm sorry. i didn't...
"what are you drinking, ladies?"
- that's what you're supposed to say.
- yes.
sorry. er, what are you drinking?
beer. pint.
and a whisky on ice.
i'm afraid we don't have ice.
next time, make sure you have ice.
this pub's come to our attention for its lack of ice.
there's more than one way to achieve equality.
before you begin to congratulate yourself,
i'm not impressed with your power to terrify people.
hmm.
whereas, i am impressed by your ability to stand up in front of an audience and speak.
i was never able to do it.
i've heard people talk about you.
you used to advocate armed revolution.
shelby company limited is prepared to offer parity for male and female workers across all the factories in our ownership.
and withdraw the pay cut for men.
in return for what?
in return for something very unusual.
but very typical of my brother.
- what does he want?
- to sit down with you and talk.
if he withdraws his pay cut, we have no need to talk.
he wants to talk about socialism and revolution.
dear god, are you serious?
my brother's a bookmaker.
bookmakers hedge their bets.
sometimes, long shots come in.
and because we emptied his buses today, he thinks we are among the runners and riders.
beneath it all, my brother is a very rational man.
beneath all what?
you mean, beneath the beatings, the cuttings,
- the shootings, the murders.
- yeah. beneath all that.
tell your brother that when we take power, all means of production will be owned by the workers.
essential industries will be taken into state control.
birmingham town hall is a rather beautiful building and we plan to preserve it.
what else does he need to know?
it's going to happen.
aren't you a bit sorry you jumped ship too soon?
he wants to take you for dinner.
i really have nothing to wear.
you'd need to wear boots.
he's suggesting dinner in a scrap metal yard.
he said you'd appreciate the sentiment.
if you don't show up, the offer of parity is withdrawn.
this is not how you conduct union business.
well, we must all make personal sacrifices for the good of the good old cause. right?
all right.
fucking hell, it smells of pig round here, doesn't it?
definitely not kosher.
come to small heath, you will go to hell for fucking breathing.
where is everybody?
stretch your legs, treacle.
fuck me, he looks like he's grown since we left london.
he's like a mushroom, isn't he?
he grows in the dark.
- i need a piss.
- do ya?
yeah? well, the place is a shit hole.
yeah? so why don't you just knock yourself out.
where is everyone?
ishmael, please, will you hit the call to prayer?
well, hit it.
thank you. thank you.
- morning alfie.
- yeah, it is. it is.
so how come everybody's in fucking bed?
so this must be goliath.
right.
let me introduce you to david.
this way, boys.
i assume that david's out of bed?
oh, right, the problem, right, between rum and gin is that gin, right, it leads to the melancholy, whereas rum incites violence.
you know, it also allows you to be liberated from your self-doubt.
i hear you're probably more in need of the old rum at the moment rather than gin, mate. hmm?
oh, dear. tommy, you've got fucking starlings, mate.
oh, yeah.
that shit will rot your pipework.
those bastards only understand one language.
it's all right, alfie.
there's no need.
it's all right, i'm, er...
i'm getting a kestrel.
i hear that you've got italians, mate.
you've got a kestrel for them and all?
- yes.
- hmm.
i have a kestrel for them as well.
well, everything is confirmed, innit?
yeah. weakness behind the eyes, didn't blink too much. all right.
you smell of smoke and coal and horses. hmm?
you are back where you belong, tommy.
i know you don't touch it, but you have a good nose.
right. well, you've got to ask yourself, seriously though, you know, did i even want to piss and shit indoors?
or was i actually born that i were to defecate in fields and the outhouses?
this is a serious issue, though, tommy,
'cause your people, your class and my religion is quite similar, actually, because you just cannot wash it out, right?
because it come out of your mother's tits.
hmm. no.
the americans want it sweeter.
what have you heard, alfie?
i heard a copper got shot.
who shot him?
- my kestrel.
- right, oh, up the stakes, very good.
where are the sicilians?
they're still using sabini for vehicles and for places to stay.
mmm-hmm. and reinforcements?
ah, they know the sicilians, don't they?
they don't trust nobody who ain't fucked a goat on the morning of their first pubic hair.
they've got traditions.
- how many are here?
- eleven.
enough to drop a man who wrapped his balls in an obe, till they fell off.
well, the real question is, alfie, which side are you playing for, eh?
fucking hell.
what kind of world is it to bring up children when your own mate can ask you that question, eh?
but the truth is, tommy, you're going to be fucking dead soon, yeah.
then your starlings, right, they will peck out your blue eyes, won't they?
and the jackdaws, they will steal your gold and your medals and pretty soon it'll be as if it never even fucking happened, mate.
tommy, there are men approaching.
yeah, let 'em pass.
right. you tell darby sabini from me, that if the italians win, they're not planning on leaving.
and after me, it'll be him, and then you, then the titanic.
they're the fucking mafia, alfie.
they've come here and can't believe our coppers are unarmed.
they can distil their liquor and it's against the law.
they've come here and they like what they see.
they're coming and they're here to stay.
mr shelby?
we've come to talk purse for the fight.
your kestrel?
tommy, when a pikey walks in with hair like that, you've gotta ask yourself,
"have i made a mistake?"
- who the fuck are you?
- who the fuck am i?
- who the fuck is this?
- i, my friend,
i am the uncle,
i'm the protector and the promoter, of that fucking thing right there in whose shadow nothing good nor godly will ever fucking grow.
that there, right, is the southern
counties welterweight champion.
he is of mixed religion, therefore he is godless, he was adopted by satan himself, before he was returned out of fear of his awkwardness.
he is impossible to marry off due to his lethal dimensions, his mother terrified, she's fucking abandoned him.
and there he is stood before you like the first of some brand new fucking species.
any man that you put before him, right, it'd be like entering a fucking threshing machine, mate.
now, will you offer your son?
name the day, mr shelby.
that's me finished for the weekend, tommy?
yeah. your mother wants me to go to the foundation... prize giving.
just you?
just me.
why?
no reason.
no reason.
no reason.
bye, michael.
tommy?
yeah?
have a good weekend.

saving your life. all this.
i'm a police officer, tommy.
i'm a fuckin' police officer, right?
doing my duty.
stopping all this!
three bodies need cleaning up.
no. enough.
tell the people who live in these houses that they are free to go about their lawful business!
tell them that the rule of law has been restored!
haven't you heard, tommy? eh?
soldiers are coming.
do you know, i remember the very first time you head-butted a policeman.
after you got your obe from the king,
i didn't think there'd be a next time.
what do you think you're gonna tell arthur?
i'll tell him the truth.
they're here.
<i>so...</i>
what the fuck happened today, tom?
we all heard, shooting in artillery square.
yeah, there was.
today, i killed three men.
now our enemies will have to act.
i suppose, they er...
i suppose they took you by surprise, did they?
no, i knew they were coming.
just after christmas,
i received a letter from luca changretta.
offering to spare my son, if i gave up tommy.
and i gave tommy up.
because that was the plan that polly and i agreed on.
i knew that luca, would want to pull the trigger himself.
so i used the set-up as bait to bring him in.
you're a fuckin' idiot, tom.
look, i didn't get luca, but i got three.
all right? that's it.
that's what happened.
- come here, you.
- ah, but, he's right.
i mean, i thought you'd gone soft.
- so you got three?
- yeah, i got three.
well, i'll drink to you, tom.
you mad bastard.
hmm.
pretty soon, you're gonna get the shakes. when your blood cools down.
let go get a drink.
dad, you got three what?
i got three shillings on a two shilling horse, my boy.
you come with us, eh?
want a drink, lizzie?
i've had a hard day.
i don't drink whisky or gin any more, tom.
why not?
as they say, it harms the baby.
yes, it can only be yours.
that day by the canal, when you were fucking somebody else in your head.
except it wasn't her who got pregnant.
have a seat, lizzie.
- all right, i know a woman, lizzie.
- there are lots of woman, tommy.
if you don't know this already, you don't know me.
i'm keepin' it.
who's gonna run my fuckin' office?
i'll find somebody.
no.
you better put a fuckin' advert in the paper, then.
i'm not laid up yet.
you're not gonna work with a child of mine inside of you.
fuck. now my hand shakes.
it's okay, tom.
we'll be okay.
all this death, lizzie...
it'll be good to have some life, eh?
i got three.
i know, tom.
one of them point-blank.
a baby, little you and me.
point-blank, lizzie.
and he looked up at me.
you'll get an allowance, every week from the company.
business is booming.
we'll erm... buy a nice house, eh?
come on, i'll drive you home.
i'm just lookin'.
hmm?
- fuck.
- linda.
- arthur, you scared me to death.
- linda!
linda, i need you to save me.
i'm dying.
you're drunk. again.
i'm drunk again.
i am drunk again.
i need you to save me.
tell me what you said to me this morning.
tell me... tell me again.
tell me.
say it, say it, say it. tell me.
we'll be back in our garden before the time comes to plant anything out.
just one winter.
just one winter.
come to bed, arthur.
they're coming, boys.
no.
no fucking way.
you've never eaten hedgehog, michael?
i'm getting back in this car.
michael, you're number two on luca changretta's hit list.
yeah, and i'll stay in a hotel.
if you stay in a hotel,
i'll know where you are.
so will the people who take you there.
so will the people who work in the hotel.
and hotels don't move around.
they don't even know where they'll be tomorrow.
they follow the patron and the crows.
and if anyone should come for you, michael, the palmers and the boswells will put up a fair fight.
take your medicine.
- i'll take them.
- pain killers.
the hills up there, they'll heal you much quicker.
fuckin' witches, the lot of them.
show some respect, mr gray.
they've agreed to welcome you on account of your blood.
take your medicine.
take the gun.
i won't be able to contact you, till you phone me.
we'll make a plan.
tommy says it won't be long.
then we'll be free.
you might learn something.
tell them your grandmother was a gypsy princess.
name of birdy boswell.
you're royalty up there, michael.
is that true, mrs gray?
what?
don't i look like royalty?
well, now that you mention it, you do.
i've been cooped up in small heath too long.
i can smell spring in the air.
do you know a longer way back, mr gold?
i know ways back, would take forever.
get in, your majesty.
<i># when your work is o ver</i>
<i># your day is done</i>
<i># put down your hammer... #</i>
i thought you were a busy woman.
<i># into my world come #</i>
do you have time for this?
- is it a buck?
- it is a buck.
good, bucks taste better.
in this smoke, i'm 16 again.
when the police were after my dad, he used to take us out.
we'd be gone for days living on what he caught.
oh... do you have a sharp knife?
i heard you have second sight.
i heard that you speak with the dead.
yes.
your wife's often around you.
she watches you.
is she watching me now?
no.
your family were healers?
yeah, long time ago.
came back when i put my head in a noose.
it's like putting your head through a window and seeing the whole world.
give me the rabbit.
and the knife.
you know, polly...
i believe it's you who's kept
tommy shelby alive all these years.
how we've kept each other alive...
that i didn't just put my head through that window.
i climbed through it.
first, i thought it was madness, but, no.
when you put your head out of that window, you can do anything you want.
'cause there are no rules.
'cause there are no risks.
now, give me the knife.
now, come here.
i can do whatever i want whenever the mood takes me.
and you are a strong handsome man.
and this is a beautiful place in the world.
and it is.
this time.
let me make one thing clear, mr gold.
i just gave michael a little speech about how no one would know where to find him.
but you'd know how to get him.
if any harm comes to michael, you shall have me as your enemy.
and none of your knives can kill me.
do you understand?
oh, i understand.
mr solomons.
mmm.
my little cousin was born blind.
as a result, i now donate a considerable sum of money to a charity which gives dogs with eyes to blind jews.
the chairman of the board recommends that those of us who were blessed with the gift of sight, and that we spend, you know, at least half an hour a day with our eyes closed so that we may that we may better understand the...
well, the darkness, and erm...
also, to increase our donations and that. mmm.
what time is it?
twenty-nine minutes past eight.
right. well, then i...
i have another minute to go, actually, but you er...
you can begin. go on.
i'm luca changretta.
oh, yeah, i know who you are. mmm.
you are a bit of a failure, aren't you?
you come all the way over here to this country, in order to kill tommy shelby, but, i mean...
well, he's not dead, is he? so...
- no.
- no.
he ain't.
how much time have i got left, mate?
ten seconds.
nine seconds.
eight seconds.
five.
four.
three.
two.
one.
right. hello.
how can i help you?
- i have a proposition for you.
- mmm. no, it's...
i already know what do you want.
yeah? i just want to hear you say it out loud so that i can check how ridiculous it is.
i hear there's gonna be a little fight.
a boxing match between your boy and tommy shelby's boy.
- eh? birmingham.
- mmm-hmm.
and the whole shelby family is gonna be there.
hmm.
and you, mr solomons, you too will be there.
- huh?
- er, that's it.
i'll tell you what, all right?
here's a gift. it's free.
a souvenir of your visit here.
goodbye. trot on.
down there is bonny street.
you know, they say you're a smart guy.
i mean, you already know what we want before we say it.
that's funny 'cause now i believe
i know what you want
- even before you say it.
- mmm? mmm.
so you gonna taste it?
you're damn fucking straight, mate.
otherwise you wouldn't still be thieving my oxygen, would ya?
because i have 200 barrels a month, yeah?
cleared by your people, distributed through your teams to this...
the thing is that people want gin these days.
well, the exit is still out there, all right? on bonny street.
yeah?
you're fucking crazy, you know that?
200 barrels, huh?
huh. what do you think, huh?
and also, i want some cash.
bang right,
'cause i've broken it down here, the, uh, list of costs pertaining to the assassination of a dear friend.
all right. now you're normal dispatch, well, is you know, â£500 cost, but you're gonna have to add another 100 to that, because tommy shelby, like me, is from an oppressed people.
then i need you to put another ton on top of that, because his brother is a fucking animal and he will come after me.
yeah. and then you will need to put another 100 on top of that, because, well, you are a fucking wop, mate.
hmm?
and you.
and then we have to deal with the ugly business which
i've been incredibly clear of before.
i'll need another â£500, because, like i stated,
tommy shelby is a very, very good friend of mine.
take all of this down there in black and white.
- all right? crack on.
- it's okay.
mr solomons,
i'm gonna be very fucking clear with you.
i don't need you to kill anybody.
i have people that i trust, okay?
so you're gonna take my boys, and you're gonna bring them to the ring as seconds.
well, in order to qualify as my seconds, right, they will first have to qualify as being jewish, yeah?
and in order to do that, they would have to replace their natural italian fucking arrogance with a jewish air of absolute certainty.
see, my good friend tom shelby, he will know the difference.
these days, back in the old country, mmm, a lot of the, uh, you know, the jewish peoples, they, uh, are having to pass themselves off as italian.
right, well, you will have to add another ton onto your bill for being a cunt, mate.
all right?
you will bring my men to birmingham.
and you will circumcise them.
yeah, you will have to circumcise them, because the peakys will check, yeah?
okay. any other requests, huh?
two hundred fucking barrels.
we have a deal.
ah...
- what's the matter?
- hmm. well...
i said we have a deal.
and you just made a deal without a negotiation, didn't ya?
yeah.
yeah, tommy shelby was right about you, wasn't he?
ada shelby?
no.
she was armed when we picked her up, sir, so we strip-searched her.
- that will be all.
- yes, sir.
i apologise, miss shelby.
the territorials can be overzealous.
your men watched.
and they will be reprimanded.
they won't see saturday.
a naked woman alone making threats against the entire british army.
a significant indicator of character.
i'll turn my back while you dress, and perhaps we can talk.
i have a dossier on each member of your family.
i know your family's extraordinary history.
fuck you.
i also have a totally blank page on which together we can write your family's immediate future.
you rehearsed your speech.
a significant indicator of a lack of confidence.
- what rank are you?
- colonel.
- may i turn?
- not unless you want to get blinded.
i'm sorry.
this has got off to a bad start.
what is "this"?
three days ago, you were seen at a meeting for the stechford communist party.
you were then seen talking to a woman called jessie eden.
turn around.
i'm leaving.
and you can burn this. it's history.
ada shelby, a person of interest and under the surveillance of special branch since you've joined the birmingham
communist party in june 1919.
i'm no longer a member of the communist party.
i know. irrelevant.
most of the more active subversives shed their official allegiances to avoid detection.
okay. let me explain it to you.
i'm no longer a member of the communist party, because i'm no longer a believer in the cause of socialism.
now open that door.
so in the past, you were blinded by love.
no.
blinded by faith.
i believed people deserve justice.
they don't.
so you've arrested me because i had a drink with jessie eden.
whisky with ice for you and a beer for her.
i met jessie eden to settle an industrial dispute.
head of acquisitions.
so you've swapped sides.
if you know what i drink, you know what i do for a living.
miss shelby, you must understand that these are extraordinary times.
general strike is certain.
attempted revolution, perhaps.
soldiers on the streets very soon.
they're already drilling.
and here stands you, a woman with her foot in both camps.
it's potentially very useful.
useful to who?
maybe you should ask your brother thomas.
put some fucking effort into it, son. the fight's in two days.
make use of the reach.
get used to the long arm on him.
get under it!
that's it. on to the corner.
talk to me about colonel ben younger.
what about him?
he's just made me a proposition.
you're in my chair.
he said you knew about it.
and remember i know when you're lying.
ben younger was an officer in the warwickshire yeomanry in flanders.
the only cavalryman who could ride a fucking horse.
i was strip-searched.
two soldiers watched.
i'm sorry, ada.
that...
the arrest was so all the neighbours would see, and word would go around.
younger is all right.
younger came to me for help.
- he's been given birmingham.
- given birmingham. by who?
by churchill. by the fucking king.
by people that want to stop the revolution.
no one's laughing any more, ada.
the home office is making provisions.
this is part of those provisions.
and how is tommy shelby, obe, going to stop a revolution?
jessie eden has accepted my invitation to dinner.
oh, of course. i'm sorry.
tommy shelby is gonna stop the revolution with his cock.
it's not her the military are interested in.
it's the people around her.
the people like you used to be.
like freddie used to be.
people that want an armed revolution.
if i get jessie eden's trust, she gives me the names of the instigators,
i give them up to the crown forces.
tommy. tommy, sweetheart, why would a man whose medals rust at the bottom of the saltley canal want to help the british military?
because i've been offered three five-year contracts to supply military vehicles to the british forces in india, ceylon, singapore and burma.
total value, two million pound.
and there'll be no strikes in your factory
'cause jessie eden will be in your bed.
tommy, this can only happen if you're still alive.
i'm planning on staying alive.
and if i'm dead, you can all go back to being what you were.
the british army came to me, ada.
i said, "why not?"
they'll put that on your grave, tom.
"tommy shelby. why not?"
you gonna help me or not?
other way round.
erm, will they want music, charlie?
we have that gramophone we found abandoned inside that gentleman's car.
no, they don't.
tommy said they're here to talk.
charlie, curly, this isjessie eden.
jessie, this is my uncle charlie and my... whatever curly is.
- this is actually lovely.
- we were just wondering
- if you'd like some music?
- no, we weren't.
- actually, jessie likes music.
- don't go to any trouble.
no, curly, go to some trouble.
go on, then.
right.
- don't i get a choice?
- i want an opinion. try it.
don't really drink gin.
then you're perfect. my gin is for women that don't really drink gin.
your gin?
let's drink to something. you chose.
to the revolution.
why not?
to the revolution.
all right, well, since i invited you for dinner, i thought i'd cook.
these two beauties were shot this morning by a poacher friend of mine at lord packwood's estate.
i thought you'd like that. these here, these were stolen from under his trees.
mr shelby, i came to talk business.
yes.
so did i.
wage cuts withdrawn, parity between men and women guaranteed.
you can instruct your members to return to work tomorrow.
and all i have to do in return is tell you everything i know about socialism.
that's what your sister said.
you don't like your gin?
it's okay.
it's okay.
what do you want to know about the cause?
i'm approaching the current political crisis as i would approach a horse race.
assessing the runners and the riders.
now the favourite is, of course, the king's horse, but the king's horse was also the favourite in 1913 when emily davison threw herself in front of it.
you know the names of suffragettes?
i'm impressed.
ah, everyone laughed at them at first, but now look, women with serious faces everywhere.
when i study a horse race, i study form, and on the other horse, the one that wants to beat the king's horse, let's call her "dangerous", shall we?
she's no form.
- that's what makes her so dangerous.
- russia.
- isn't that form?
- ah.
the russians are not like the english.
we're beer, they're petrol.
so i invited you here for dinner, because you know people.
people that want to make this fight real with guns and ammunition.
so before i place a bet on who's gonna win,
i need to know how strong they are.
how serious they are.
your concern is that if the unthinkable happened, you would find yourself on the wrong side of the barricades.
well, as you can see, my natural side of the barricades, is the same as yours and, as you know,
i once believed...
but the war changed you?
yeah.
man i love couldn't speak when he got back.
not one word.
i've said very few true words since.
men who blew the whistles in france are our enemy.
and you count yourself among those who want a real fight?
i do.
- well, well.
- yes.
not just in my dreams. in the day now.
and you're not alone.
i am not alone.
well, well.
i've researched you.
we have researched you.
you've never been a friend to the government.
they've used you.
and i imagine you've found out already that no amount of money allows you to pass through the steel sheets that separate class from class.
yes.
yes, that i have learnt.
men like you would terrify them.
i'm betting them, what they do.
would i change the odds, do you think?
it's all wound up, tom.
erm, you just put the needle on and let it spin.
and there are some popular records, mostly romantic. uh...
thank you, curly.
food's nearly ready.
let's eat before we dance, shall we?
so we're going to dance?
i think so.
swear to god. swear to god.
she gave me sixpence, she sends me to the shop, margarine, eggs and bread, and i came back...
with a top hat and a coconut.
and that was all the money we had for the whole fucking week.
and my mum beat me with a fucking frying pan.
why the hell did you buy a top hat and a coconut?
because i thought she deserved it.
i thought we all did.
and i could never understand why people like us only had bread and fucking lard.
and i wanted to be different.
that's what i wanted.
and you are.
well...
when i showed you that photo of greta jurossi, your face changed.
she wanted everything to be different.
the whole world.
as do i.
shall we have some more music?
you were married, but she was killed.
<i>bye bye blackbird reminds you of your sweetheart, eh?</i>
yes.
you want it on fast or slow?
let's be slow.
i betterjust sit. i'm drunk.
come on.
<i># i'm a young girl
and ha ve just come o ver</i>
<i># over from the country
where they do things big</i>
<i># and amongst the boys
i've got me a lover</i>
<i># and since i've got a lover
why i don 't care a fig... #</i>
will you help us, tommy?
soon. soon.
arrange a meeting with the appropriate people, and i'll be there.
beanie. come on, boy.
get over here, you lazy bastard.
now, what's all that, eh?
the room is, uh, clean, mr shelby.
right. lock it all down.
all right, boys. lock her down.
no weapons.
no admission if you've any weapons.
you're good. go on.
go on!
arthur!
can i open the book, can i?
right. open it up.
you.
gentlemen!
now you listen to me.
you put all your money on the gold.
you hear me? let's fucking fine dine.
oi, jacko.
come on, boys, and place your bets with me!
honestjohnny dodds.
the only show in town in order of your special constable brothers, the peaky fucking blinders.
bonnie boy!
there we go, boy.
bring out that fucking tiger, eh?
go on.
tiger's already out.
fair enough.
bonnie, mr shelby will give you a 20% cut if you put goliath down in the fourth round.
been caged up too long, brother.
if the women are going to have fun, so am i!
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand #</i>
<i>i just got served a black hand.</i>
<i>everybody will have got one.
they're coming for us all.</i>
<i>these men will not leave our city</i>
<i>until the whole family is dead.</i>
<i>this was all my fault.
it was me that shot the old man.</i>
john's dead because of me.
<i>within a four-mile radius of the garrison</i>
<i>every man is a guard and a soldier for us.</i>
<i>we're going back.
back to small heath.</i>
<i>that's how it works. an eye for an eye.</i>
<i>it's called vendetta.</i>
we are an organisation, but different. imagine...
<i>none of you will survive.</i>
<i>and how is tommy shelby obe, going to stop a revolution?</i>
<i>ifl getjessie eden's trust,</i>
<i>she gives me the names of the instigators,</i>
<i>i'll give them up to the crown forces.</i>
<i>i want you to help my son achieve his ambition.</i>
you're a peaky blinder now, son.
<i>we control him, run the book, control the odds.</i>
<i>we got a lot going on, that's all.</i>
so it might be a good time to get around?
mr shelby will give you a 20% cut if you put goliath down in the fourth round.
so you're gonna take my boys and you're gonna bring them to the ring as seconds.
yeah, tommy shelby was right about you. wasn't he?
<i># take a walk to the edge of town</i>
<i># and go across the tracks</i>
<i># where the viaduct looms</i>
<i># like a bird of doom</i>
<i># as it shifts and cracks</i>
<i># where secrets lie in the border fires</i>
<i># in the humming wires</i>
<i># hey man, you're never coming back</i>
<i># past the square, past the bridge</i>
<i># past the mills, past the stacks</i>
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand</i>
<i># a red right hand</i>
<i># with a red right hand #</i>
yeah, you're like me, tommy, you can't bear to watch a fight which has got rules.
tommy, right, imagine...
imagine that you could not see.
at all, you was born blind.
then one day you open up your eyes and you can see everything in the world.
when before you could only touch it or smell it.
hmm. there it is.
the revelation.
innit?
i've had one.
yeah, saw a beautiful house down in margate.
great big white building...
monkey puzzle tree against the sky blue.
beautiful. a piece of heaven.
actually, you see, the way the earth, it curves, i thought to myself,
"alfie, what are you doing?
"what are you doing?
"why don't you just sell every ounce of gold and sell
"every barrel of rum you got and just buy yourself some time, mate?"
i need to buy myself some time.
you're moving to margate?
i am actually, yeah.
i need to get myself some rest.
i need some rest.
plus, the americans are here now, aren't they?
so, that's it.
yeah. it's been that way ever since the war, innit? the americans.
big fucks small.
always, actually.
hmm?
and there is a fight going on, out there, between big and small.
big will fuck small.
right. margate then. blue skies, heaven.
i will see you, tommy.
might appear.
stay and watch the fight, alfie?
no, you're all right.
i already know who wins.
don't i?
cheer up.
round one!
left, right.
oh!
bonnie! bonnie!
i know he's a big bastard but you got to...
- where's solomons?
- apparently he doesn't watch.
look at that corner. look.
the men there, they don't know fighters.
i don't like it.
you feel it though, tom, don't ya?
i feel it. we're all right.
we're surrounded by soldiers, arthur.
alfie's men were strip searched.
we're all right.
right, come on, gypsy boy, let's go.
round two!
so what did tommy say when you told him?
he said i'd get a weekly allowance.
oh, he can be romantic.
course as company treasurer,
i shall be questioning that expense.
he said something like, "we've had enough death, let's have some life."
poll...
this fight is fixed, isn't it?
poor gypsy boy's getting battered out there.
right. you said you have some news?
lizzie has some news.
polly.
well, tell her. now!
while the men are screaming for blood.
have a swig. you're gonna need it.
i'm up the duff.
and it's tommy's.
how far gone are you?
if i were going to london
i'd be in coventry.
and are you carrying on past coventry?
all the way to fucking
piccadilly circus.
you found out whether she's having a boy or a girl, poll?
no.
go on then.
it's a girl.
call her ruby.
ruby shelby.
she'll be a star in a hollywood movie.
hmm.
congratulations.
hey, linda.
welcome to the extraordinary general meeting of the shelby ladies club.
is there spit on my back?
there were men out there spitting.
it's fucking disgusting.
no, there's no spit on your back.
don't let us stop you doing what you came in to do.
what?
it's helped me get through the fucking nightmare of being stuck in this city.
well, since you're here and you're almost family,
lizzie's got some news.

yes, it's tommy.

shelby lady now, linda.

tommy.
hello, michael.
there's been a change of plan.
<i>mr gold will come and get you.</i>
arthur's dead.
tommy, i've been trying to think of words...
don't.
words don't work.
michael, we're in a grave situation.
tommy has a plan.
instead of going to australia, you're going to new york.
why?
'cause the company has business to attend to in america.
will i be coming back?
train leaves in an hour, michael.
you made a choice.
you knew i was gonna be shot and you chose not to tell me.
i chose my mum.
when all this business is over we'll all be free to make our own choices.
so is that it?
<i>you get the train to liverpool then the ss monroe.</i>
boat sails tomorrow.
now you can go.
i need an overseas connection, please.
usa.
- tommy!
- it's all right, let her come.
please.
once we're all finished.
<i>your note talked about making terms for peace.</i>
but my son says there are no terms.
you took my husband and my son.
we took two of your brothers.
the vendetta is done.
we say the vendetta is won.
we will take everything you have.
all your businesses, signed over to us.
you agree to this.
or my son will kill you all.
one by one.
the vendetta is won.
that's it.
no more killing.
who do you think you were, mr shelby?
why don't you let him know we're hereto buy his business?
mr solomons!
mr changretta's here to see you!
come now.
my peaky!
they say he was a captain.
oh, yeah?
then you might wanna tell them not to open that fucking door.
seems mr solomons already left town.
so all this is mine.
huh.
you don't knock?
you don't know my new address?
hello, lizzie, how are you?
i know your new address, lizzie, because it was me who bought you the new fucking house.
then why don't you visit it?
we have been busy.
busy doing what?
preparing for tomorrow.
why, what's tomorrow?
luca changretta is coming to birmingham.
it's our turn.
he's already taken over
alfie solomons, sabini,
titanics... all of them.
and now he's coming to take control of shelby company limited.
what are we going to do about that?
we're gonna let him have it.
all that's left of the peaky fucking blinders.
i've had my lawyer draw up these papers.
cover, uh, every enterprise in your possession.
bars, restaurants, warehouses.
every fucking thing that you've taken all these years to gather together.
you will sign them all over to my family or you're gonna die.
right here.
i would've buried you all but my mother, she, uh, she knows you, she said.
it'll be worse for you if i let you live and take away everything that you have.
search him.
especially don't trust this bitch.
so.
sign.
every fucking one of them.
you can sign them on your knees.
on the floor.
get on your fucking knees and sign.
a friend of mine once said...
big fucks small.
so i had to find someone bigger than you.
now, you may know there are two families in brooklyn, who want take over your monopoly on the import of liquor into new york.
but if they move against you in new york, they'll start a war between the families.
but if you were to die in a vendetta with some fucking bookmaker in birmingham, they could take over your business without a war.
we also contacted a businessman in chicago.
he's also interested in moving into the liquor business in new york.
his name is alphonse capone.
you been talking to that fat fuck?
you see, all the blood relatives you brought with you from new york, they're all dead,
mr changretta.
and these men here, they work for money, for the highest bidder.
they now have new orders.
is that right?
is that right?
and you, matteo?
hey.
very fucking...
<i>arthur's been injured but he's all right, poll.</i>
<i>we need to make them believe that he's dead.</i>
<i>to everyone but you, me, and linda,</i>
<i>arthur shelby is dead.</i>
<i>i've got it all worked out.</i>
<i>we can use his death to win this war.</i>
tell your people in chicago that michael gray will sign the import licence to new york.
300 barrels of english dry gin a month.
leave.
all of ya.
tell your boss what you saw here today.
and tell him...
you don't fuck with the peaky blinders.
nice. hey!
listen up. um.
before we go and eat,
i'd like to say a few words.
last time we were all here, it ended badly.
yeah.
and now, we're in a happier place.
that's it.
i'd just like to raise a toast.
hold on.
a few words i want to say from the heart, and this time, you're gonna let me finish, tommy.
now, as you all know,
arthur shelby is dead.
'cause of that,
tommy's offered me a way out.
a new identity.
start a whole new life for meself.
i've thought about it.
made a decision.
i ain't fucking going nowhere.
our enemies are gone.
dead, all of them.
for the first time since me, my two kid brothers,
tommy and john, enlisted in the warwickshire yeomanry, we have peace.
so.
i think i'd like to make a proposal to all of you, the shelby company limited, insist that tommy here take some time off.
time you took a holiday, tom.
put your feet up.
war's over.
no one wants to kill us.
to peace.
to peace.
i do hope you're gonna leave the dog out of this.
you were easy to find.
yeah, well there's a good reason for that, tommy.
because i wanted it to be here.
i once told you, alfie, that for business reasons or in bad blood,
i would kill you.
i have no business reasons.
it seems you have retired.
so this is all purely for bad blood, is it, tommy?
- yeah.
- right. yeah.
told you.
i wanted it to be here.
- you gonna look after this dog?
- no.
right then. well, his name is cyril and he'll be very upset and distressed, so you'll need to find him someone.
- you're not armed?
- no.
don't be daft.
the only thing i got on me is fucking cancer, mate.
yeah.
riddled with it.
doctor told me i might have picked it up in france in the gas or something.
he even showed me a photograph...
alfie, stop talking.
so i said, "margate" right, and here i am.
- come on, tommy.
- alfie, look at me.
there's an honourable reason now to pull that trigger...
alfie, look at me.
fucking get on with it.
stop acting like a little girl.
alfie!
<i># jumped in the river, what did i see?</i>
<i># black-eyed angels swam with me</i>
<i># a moon full of stars and astral cars</i>
<i># and all the figures i used to see</i>
<i># all my lovers were there with me</i>
<i># all my past and futures</i>
mr shelby.
mr shelby.
mr shelby.
<i># there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt</i>
mr shelby, you are not yourself.
i should call a doctor.
it's all right, frances.
i'll call mrs gray.
i know what this is...
it's just myself talking to myself about myself.
out. thank you.
<i># i jumped into the river</i>
<i># black-eyed angels swam with me</i>
<i># a moon full of stars and astral cars</i>
<i># and all the figures i used to see... #</i>
charlie.
since i know you won't go yourself,
i've been to a doctor on your behalf.
no, it's all right.
none of the boys know you're sick.
i'm not sick, polly.
it starts when you stop, when you rest.
could be nerves.
the war.
it might be the alcohol.
blue devils, they call that.
yeah, well. yeah.
yeah, it's the fucking booze.
it's the booze, the booze got out and the booze got in me bones.
lizzie wants to see you.
no.
tom, she's showing.
i don't want to see lizzie, poll.
shit. maybe it's in us.
it's with shelbys.
it's in our gypsy blood.
we live somewhere between life and death, waiting to move on.
and in the end, we accept it.
we shake hands with devils and we walk past them.
mr shelby, you're meant to be resting.
i've learned something, frances.
there's no rest for me in this world.
perhaps in the next.
them there, you pay out.
this one, you have to think.
use your fucking head, man.
right, even money.
whose fucking idea was it that i go on holiday?
welcome back, tommy. how was it?
what'd you get up to?
went fishing, played golf.
golf's fucking boring.
boring and easy.
yeah, well, what's the plan?
<i>i need you to give this tojessie eden.</i>
<i>by hand.</i>
- yes, mr shelby.
- by your hand.
this will be the last job you'll do for me.
you can go to glasgow and be with your family.
you're free.
you need to sign all of these.
so you shook hands with the devil?
yeah.
and i walked past him.
poll.
i've had an idea.
oh, fuck.
<i>"dearjessie, now, more certainly than ever,</i>
<i>"i believe things must change.
things must change.</i>
<i>"the general strike is holding.</i>
<i>"we've not an hour to lose.</i>
<i>"meet me."</i>
<i>- i've made up my mind, jessie.
- about what?</i>
your cause is now my cause.
i wanna help.
the strike is holding. i want to meet the people who can take this further.
are you serious?
yeah.
i've done a lot of thinking.
right. i'll arrange a meeting.
the operator knows my voice.
give me the name and the number.
his name is casey douglas.
it's sparkhill 453.
right.
and he's the leader of the cell?
he's in contact with london and moscow.
good.
yeah. sparkhill 453.
<i>you are quite a creature,
mr shelby.</i>
<i>when i received your note,
i wasn't sure you could deliver.</i>
i've made contact with a soviet agent inside the birmingham communist party.
and do you have a name?
and an address and a telephone number.
i can be of great use to you.
i can give you the name of any communist party member, who is prepared to cross the line into armed revolution.
we're in the fourth day of a general strike, which appears to be holding.
even if it fails today, tomorrow they may succeed.
mmm.
and you're offering to help ensure they never succeed.
if my cover is maintained,
i can begin to shape the movement and organise it myself.
and undermine it?
rise through the ranks of the wider
socialist movements.
of course.
you want something in return.
what this time? a knighthood?
my proposal.
and my conditions.
for the attention of winston churchill?
he holds me in very high regard.
are you serious?
breaking up a revolutionary cell is one thing.
given my position of influence in my home city.
i could be of much more use to you than that.
