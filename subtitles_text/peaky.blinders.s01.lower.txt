the girl who tells fortunes?
they're doing a magic spell. to make it win a race.
the horse's name is monaghan boy.
kempton. 3:00. monday.
you ladies have a bet yourselves, but don't tell anyone else.
and abraham made his home in a cave.
but it was good. because god resided there with him.
you see, children, god does not care if you live in a slum, or in a mansion.
god does not care if you are rich, or you are poor...
morning, sir.
morning, mr shelby.
- come on, lad.
- good day, sir.
- morning, mr shelby.
- sir.
good day, mr shelby.
finn?
arthur's mad as hell.
what does a 10-year-old know about hell? eh?
i'm 11 sunday.
i'm looking for tommy.
get your bets in now for the 2:30 at kempton.
right, what we got on percy piper?
piper going well in the soft, lads. down to fours.
fours.
- okay, monaghan boy?
- wanna push that down, mate.
two to one, still.
two to one. get your bets in now.
what do you say? we got topper in, he's an old favourite.
four to one.
tommy! tommy!
tommy, look at the book. just look.
- tommy!
- all on monaghan boy.
- good work, john.
- tommy!
get in here. now.
that'll be six pennies, nipper.
that's ten bob you'll see for that.
now, you were seen doing the powder trick down at garrison courts.
times are hard.
people need a reason to lay a bet.
there was a chinese.
the washerwomen say she's a witch.
- it helps them believe.
- we don't mess with chinese.
- look at the book.
- chinese have cutters of their own.
we agreed, arthur.
i'm taking charge of drumming up their money.
what if monaghan boy wins, tommy?
you fixing races now?
do you have permission from billy kimber to be fixing races? hmm?
and what's got into you?
you think we can take on the chinese and billy kimber?
- billy's got a bloody army!
- i think, arthur.
that's what i do.
i think.
so that you don't have to.
there's news from belfast.
i'm calling a family council tonight at 8:00.
i want all of us there.
you hear me?
there's trouble coming.
all right, shut up now. shut up.
comrades, we're here today to take a vote on strike action.
yes!
but before we have a show of hands for that, let's have a show of hands from all those who fought in france.
all those who stood side by side with your comrades, and watched your comrades fall.
raise your hands.
the blood shed on flanders fields.
the sweat of your brows.
who reaps the rewards?
is it you?
- no, no.
- no!
is it your wives?
- no, no.
- no, no.
well, who then? do they stand among us?
<i>'nu. 'nm!</i>
or do they sit at home, comfortable, with a full belly?
while you scrape to find enough to put shoes on your children's feet!
and what is the reward they offer you for your sacrifices made?
a fucking cut in your wages!
that is your reward!
raise a hand, all those who want to strike!
- yes! yes!
- yes! yes!
on the house, mr shelby.
- i'll take a mild.
- right.
cheers, thomas.
good health to you.
crown of a prince.
- soon to be king, i'd bet.
- you don't bet.
no, but these past few days i've been speculating.
about what?
one of my union comrades has a sister.
works in the telegraph office at the bsa factory.
she says, over the past week, they've had messages coming up from london to the brass.
from winston churchill himself.
something about a robbery.
a robbery of national significance, it's said.
she found a list of names left in the telegraph machine.
and on that list was your name and my name together.
what kind of a list would have the name of a communist and the name of a bookmaker side by side?
perhaps it's a list of men who give false hope to the poor.
the only difference between you and me, freddie, is that, sometimes... my horses stand a chance of winning.
you know, there are days - when i hear about the cuttings and beatings - that i really wish i'd let you take that bullet in france.
believe me, there are nights i wish you had.
hey!
they're gonna kill me!
on three! one, two, three, go!
breathe, danny. breathe!
they're gonna kill me! they're gonna kill me!
- they're gonna kill me!
- danny! danny, danny, you're home.
we're all home in england.
you're not in france.
you're not an artillery shell, danny, you're a man.
eh?
you're not a whizz-bang, you're a human being, danny.
you're all right. you're all right.
you're all right.
up, up!
it's all right.
it's all right.
oh, hell.
did i do it again?
you did it again, danny.
you gotta stop doing this, man.
- he's all right.
- oh god, mr shelby, i'm sorry.
it's all right.
- you go home to your wife now, danny.
- yeah.
and get all that smoke and mud out of your head, eh?
yes, mr shelby. i'm sorry.
go on.
mr shelby, you have to do something about him.
damn right, harry.
you pay the peaky blinders a lot of money for protection.
you're the law around here now, tommy, aren't you?
maybe you should put a bullet in danny whizz-bang's head like they do with mad horses.
maybe you'll have to put a bullet in my head someday, too.
bring the bill to the peaky blinders.
we'll take care of it.
look at the gun.
- recognise it?
- mmm.
- fuck!
- get up off your arse, you mumping pig.
aunt poll, what the fuck did you do that for?
finn was playing with this this afternoon by the cut.
it was loaded. nearly blew ada's tits off.
it must have fell out of me pocket.
he said he found it on the sideboard of the betting shop.
with bullets in it.
i...
i must have been drunk.
when are you not drunk?
look, aunt polly, i'm sorry.
i'm... i'm sorry.
we'll keep this between ourselves if you swear not to leave guns lying around.
look, i know having four kids without a woman is hard, but my boot's harder. now come on, were late.
right!
i've called this family meeting because i've got some very important news.
scudboat and lovelock got back from belfast last night.
they were buying a stallion to cover their mares.
they were in a pub on the shankhill road yesterday, and in that pub there was a copper.
handing out these.
"if you're over five feet and can fight, come to birmingham."
they're recruiting protestant irishmen to come over here as special.
- to do what?
- to clean up the city, ada.
he's the chief inspector.
the last four years, he's been clearing the ira out of belfast.
how do you know so bloody much?
'cause i asked the coppers on our payroll.
and why didn't you tell me?
i'm telling you.
so why are they sending him to birmingham?
well, there's been all these bloody strikes at the bsa.
and the austin works, lately.
now the papers are talking about sedition.
and revolution.
i reckon it's communists he's after.
so this copper's gonna leave us alone, right?
there are irishmen in green lanes who left belfast to get away from him.
they say catholic men who crossed him used to disappear in the night.
yeah, but we ain't ira.
we bloody fought for the king.
anyway, we're peaky blinders.
we're not scared of coppers.
- he's right.
- if they come for us, we'll cut them a smile each.
so, arthur. is that it?
arthur: what do you think, aunt poll?
this family does everything open.
you've nothing more to say to this meeting, thomas?
no.
nothing that's women's business.
this whole bloody enterprise was women's business while you boys were away at war.
what's changed?
we came back.
and the lord will smite the unholy when the great judgement comes.
and judgment is coming, my friends.
judgment is coming to this wicked city.
and your wickedness and your fornication will be revealed.
you cannot hide from the creator.
you cannot hide from the almighty himself.
the creator sees all.
you cannot hide from the true and living god.
get off with ya!
ahh!
fuck off.
that's it. i don't go any further.
i have ten minutes. what do you want?
an explanation.
always been able to tell when you're hiding something.
people round here talk.
some of them work at the bsa.
i've been talking to the wives of factory hands.
detectives have been asking questions in the proofing shops.
nothing happens in that factory without you knowing about it.
speak.
god and aunt polly are listening.
it was meant to be routine.
i had a buyer in london for some motorcycles.
i asked my men to steal me four bikes with petrol engines.
i'm guessing my men were drunk.
<i>there's a still inside the factory makes tram line gin.</i>
<i>they picked up the wrong fucking crate.</i>
<i>the boys dropped it at charlie strong's yard, as agreed.</i>
<i>must have taken it from the proofing bay, instead of the export bay.</i>
holy sweet baby of mary.
inside we found 25 lewis machine guns,
10,000 rounds of ammunition,
50 semi-automatic rifles, 200 pistols with shells.
jesus, tommy.
all bound for libya.
sitting right there in charlie strong's yard.
tell me you threw them in the cut.
we put them in the stables out of the rain.
the guns hadn't been greased yet.
so that's why they sent a cop from belfast?
maybe, maybe not.
thomas, you're a bookmaker, a robber, a fighting man.
you're not a fool.
you sell those guns to anyone who has use to them, you will hang.
dump them somewhere the police can find them.
maybe if they know they haven't fallen into the wrong hands, this might blow over.
- tell charlie to dump them tonight.
- no.
he won't move contraband under a full moon.
three days until it wanes.
then you'll do the right thing?
you have your mother's common sense.
but your father's devilment.
i see them fighting.
let your mother win.
i got tickets for the penny crush.
they're showing a tom mix picture.
i'm not in the mood for the pictures tonight, ada.
well, i'm not doing it here again. i got covered in mud last time.
let's just walk a bit.
if we go down as far as greet, we could go to a pub.
your brothers have friends in greet.
they have friends everywhere, we'd have to walk to london.
i'm with you 'cause you're the only man round here not scared of them.
oh, i'm scared of them all right.
but you love me more than you fear them, right?
i don't want to be always sneaking about.
- soon, we'll tell them.
- when?
how did the family meeting go?
usual
- there's a new copper coming.
- i heard.
mmm.
and tommy says he's after the likes of you.
so maybe you should burn your books and stop making speeches.
oh, my ada.
the only princess of the royal family of the kingdom of small heath.
i'm just a poor communist frog with a big mouth.
give me a kiss, princess ada.
i'm here about the job as a barmaid.
- are you mad?
- am i what?
- do you know about this place?
- i saw it in an advertisement.
- job's been filled.
- it was in yesterday's paper.
believe me, love, i'm doing you a favour.
i'm not asking for favours, i'm asking for employment.
you're too...nice.
- how would you know?
- and too pretty.
they'd have you up against a wall.
i have experience. and references.
- what part of ireland are you from?
- galway.
oh.
i worked in dublin.
me mother was from galway.
you're too pretty.
watch.
and listen.
<i># i wish i was</i>
<i># in carrickfergus</i>
<i># only for nights</i>
<i># in ballygrand</i>
<i># i would swim over</i>
<i># the deepest ocean</i>
<i># the deepest ocean</i>
<i># my love to find</i>
<i># my boyhood friends</i>
<i># and my own relations</i>
<i># have all passed on now</i>
<i># like the melting snow #</i>
in ireland... my singing made them cry and stopped them fighting.
well, i hope you know a lot of songs.
babies discarded with the fish bones and egg shells.
girls,
11 years old, pierced and punctured by old men for thrupence a time.
rutted upon like animals.
degradation.
fathers with their daughters, brothers and sisters sharing beds.
beggars and thieves left to run in the streets.
and astride the whole stinking pile of wounds and rotting flesh... your masters!
the men who you touch your cap to.
the peaky blinders!
the vicious, merciless gangs who blind those that see and cut out the tongues of those who talk.
you are worse than them!
those of you who have taken their bribes these years since the war.
those of you who look the other way.
you are worse than them!
god damn you for soiling your uniforms!
and then... there are the ira fenians.
and the communists.
blacker hearts still.
they feed on the pus of all this corruption.
like maggots in a corpse.
and, like maggots, if left to swell they will eventually swarm like flies and spread their rotten philosophy across the country and across the world!
those then... are our enemies.
a three-headed beast.
it is my job... to decapitate each one, and by god i will do it!
i don't trust any of youse until you earn my trust.
and that takes some earning.
these are the new men who will bolster your ranks.
good men, from god-fearing families.
by the time the sun sets... they will be sworn in and in uniform.
and by sunrise tomorrow they will be on the streets.
god help those who stand in our way!
sorry, mr shelby.
right.
woman: move out of the way for mr shelby.
- this way.
- mr shelby.
you see, ladies, when you're out with a blinder you don't have to queue.
right.
i want a blow job off both of you before they let the ordinary people in.
away you go. take your hat off.
what the fuck!
who the fuck are you?
i'm arthur fucking shelby!
arthur shelby.
lead pack dog of the peaky blinders.
look at me.
bastard!
your uniform?
terrifying, i'm sure.
- did he have a gun?
- no gun.
knife in his sock. cosh in his belt.
now, mr shelby,
i want you to see this as me introducing myself to you, you understand.
in all the world, the only thing that interests me is the truth.
what do you know about the robbery?
what robbery?
i will ask you again.
what do you know about the robbery?
i swear to god, i don't know what you're talking about.
what fucking robbery?!
after 35 years of dealing with animals like you,
i can tell just by sniffing the air whether or not you're lying.
i'm not fucking lying, all right?
i'm not fucking lying!
i know.
i see nothing of interest behind the blood in your eyes.
and no blood in your veins that could carry... even a trace of cunning or guile.
but understand this.
it is well within my power to have you and the rest of your scum family face down in the canal before the year is out.
on the other hand... we can help each other.
is it always this busy in the day time?
nah, these boys are on their way to st andrews.
- to pray?
- that'll be the day!
st andrews is a football ground. the blues are playing.
that's the forward line there, and that's the goalie, believe it or not.
hello!
i need a bottle of rum.
grace, whatever it is, it's on the house.
- a whole bottle?
- yeah.
- white or dark rum?
- don't care.
right, lads, what'll it be? two?
thank you.
harry said it's on the house.
are you a whore?
'cause if you're not, you're in the wrong place.
he's one of them you warned me about.
look, grace, you're a friendly girl, but be careful.
if i say something's on the house, then say nothing to whoever you're serving.
if they decide that they want you, then there's nothing anybody could do about it.
lucky for you, since he got back from france
tommy doesn't want anybody at all.
yes, lads? john, wipe the blood out of his eye.
- since when did you give orders?
- i'm a trained nurse.
don't make me laugh.
- it hurts me face.
- i bloody am.
you went to one first aid class in the church hall and got thrown out for giggling.
not before i learned how to stop somebody from choking.
i'm not bloody choking, am i?
you will be when i wrap this cloth round your neck.
let me see him.
all right, have this.
give me that.
you're all right.
he said mr churchill sent him to birmingham.
national interest, he said.
something about a robbery.
he said he wants us to help him.
we don't help coppers.
he knew all about our war records.
he said we're patriots.
like him.
wants us to be his eyes and ears.
i said...
i said we'd have a family meeting, take a vote.
well, why not? hmm?
we've no truck with fenians or communists.
what's wrong with you?
what the fuck is wrong with him lately?
if i knew, i'd buy the cure from compton's chemists.
<i># i am just a young girl</i>
<i># i have just come over</i>
<i># over from the country</i>
<i># where they do things big</i>
<i># and amongst the boys</i>
<i># i've got myself a lover</i>
<i># and since i have a lover</i>
<i># i don't care a fig</i>
<i># the boy i love is up in the gallery</i>
<i># the boy! love is looking at me</i>
<i># can't you see him standing there?</i>
<i># waving his handkerchief</i>
<i># as merry as a robin</i>
<i># that sings on the tree #</i>
we haven't had singing in here since the war.
why do you think that is, harry?
so, did arthur say, er... what kind of a deal this new copper offered him?
god! the second your balls are empty, it's back onto politics.
what did tommy say?
he didn't say anything. you know what he's like.
yeah, i know what he's like.
likes to take his fights onto the mud.
doesn't like to stand and wait.
you know what he'd do if he found out about us?
he could try.
sometimes it's like you're with me just to show you can.
one day me and tommy will be on the same side again.
tommy!
no!
hey, what you do?
we're closed.
go home.
- go home, crazy man.
- they're gonna kill me!
i say go home, crazy man.
- they're gonna kill me!
- i said, go home.
big spiders!
secretary of state, this is chief inspector campbell.
mr churchill, sir.
may i say what a great honour it is to meet you.
bit of a whistle-stop tour.
- love the hat, by the way.
- thank you.
it's beaver.
so, how are you settling in?
i've set up a command network.
i've agents in place across the city, who will act as my eyes and ears.
and i've begun to interrogate suspects vigorously.
you were in belfast.
understand you broke a few fenian hearts.
a rat's nest, sir.
so, who do you think stole the guns?
the fenians or the communists?
if it is the ira fenians,
i will find them and find the guns.
if it is the communists, i will find them and find the guns.
if it is common criminals, i will find them and find the guns.
to me, there is no distinction between any of the above.
now, i chose you because you're effective.
but remember this, mr campbell- this is england, not belfast.
bodies thrown in the rivers wash up in the papers here.
you must keep the existence of these stolen guns out of the news, otherwise we are simply advertising them for sale.
if there are bodies to be buried... dig holes.
and dig them deep.
i want everything accounted for.
down to the last bullet.
uncle charlie.
a word.
get a boa rd.
there's no moon.
we can take them out to the turning point beyond gas street and leave them on the bank.
they'll be found by railwaymen, first thing.
is that agreement?
i changed my mind.
you what?
i've an alternative strategy.
tell curly to take her out to the old tobacco wharf.
there's a lock-up mooring we used to keep cigarettes.
he knows it.
when the boat leaves your yard, it's no longer your concern.
have you lost your fucking mind?
have you not seen the streets?
they've sent a fucking army to find these things.
that's right.
they've shown their hand.
their hand?
if they want them back this bad, they'll have to pay.
that's the way of the world.
fortune drops something valuable into your lap, you don't just dump it on the bank of the cut.
you're blood, tommy.
i've always looked out for you like a dad.
you're going to bring only hell down on your head.
this copper takes no prisoners.
i'm told he didn't serve.
reserved occupation.
is it another war you're looking for, tommy?
the tobacco wharf.
by order of the peaky blinders.
are you in position?
i am, sir.
first impressions?
i'm quite shocked at how these people live.
have you found anything out that might help me?
i interrogated the head of the peaky blinders.
he didn't know anything.
a brute.
it strikes me that it isn't arthur who heads the shelby family.
it's the younger one.
thomas.
they say he won two medals for gallantry in the war.
you sound fascinated.
however, my opinion has not changed.
the bookmaker gangs have other business and the communists are too weak to have planned this.
i believe the guns were taken by the ira.
you must not let your personal history cloud your judgement.
what history?
that the ira murdered my father will not affect my judgement.
if you see any guns, check the serial numbers against that list.
your father... was the finest officer i ever worked with.
i know he'd be very, very proud of you.
danny, as you know, the man you killed was italian.
those two men over there are his brothers.
if i let the italians do this, danny, they'll cut off your manhood and let you drain.
that's how those bastards do things.
so, to stop a war breaking out between us and the italians, to save you from their barbarity,
i said i would dispatch you myself.
they're here to witness.
i died over there anyway, tommy.
i left my fucking brains in the mud.
do you have any last requests, comrade?
you look out for my rosie and my boys.
see they get apprenticeships.
at the bsa factory or the austin.
and they'll make foremen, i know they will.
just...ordinary.
just ordinary men.
and they won't get told to do this shit.
this shit... this shit that we got told to do!
i suppose i ought to pray now.
those fucking guns, they blew god right outta me head.
is that boat for me?
we have to get your body out of the city, danny.
this new copper, you know.
don't bury me anywhere there's mud.
okay?
promise me.
bury me on a hill, and tell rosie where.
you're a good man, and a good soldier.
yes, sergeant major.
in the bleak mid-winter...
where are ya?
it bloody won.
monaghan boy bloody won!
yeah. it won.
and word will spread.
so the next time we do the powder trick, it won't be just a garrison that'll bet on the horse.
it'll be the whole of small heath.
and you know what?
the horse will win again.
and the third time we do it we'll have the whole of birmingham betting on it.
a thousand-quid bet on the magic horse.
and that time... when we are ready... the horse will lose.
think about it.
you okay, danny?
i'm still in shock.
are you sure this isn't heaven?
if it was heaven, what would i be doing here?
tommy wanted you to think it was real.
try and knock some sense into you.
a shell full of sheep brains hurts pretty bad.
aye, it was meant to.
so, where are you taking me?
london.
tommy has a little job for you.
give you a chance to say thanks.
you're a peaky blinder now, danny.
bad week?
heard there was no moon last night.
- i checked. did you do the right thing?
- yes, i did the right thing.
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track #</i>
<i>he's a chief inspector.</i>
i reckon it's communists he's after.
so this copper's going to leave us alone, right?
what the fuck!
i want you to see this as me introducing myself to you.
he said mr churchill sent him to birmingham.
something about a robbery.
thomas, you're a bookmaker. you're not a fool.
you sell these guns to anyone who has use to them, you will hang.
i'm just a poor communist frog with a big mouth.
i'm with you 'cause you're the only man around here not scared of them.
the only difference between you and me, freddie, is that, sometimes, my horses stand a chance of winning.
tommy!
you're fixing races now.
<i>grace". i'm here about the job as a barmaid.</i>
are you in position?
i am, sir.
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track</i>
<i># where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom</i>
<i># as it shifts and cracks</i>
<i># where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires... #</i>
i thought you said we were going to the fair.
we have business first. come on. bring your wits.
- what business?
- that's the lee family.
- tommy! 'johnny-dogs!
tommy, how the hell are ya?
all the better for getting the city smoke out of me lungs.
i thought you became a bit too grand for us.
- i've been busy.
- i'm riding with the lee family now.
i heard. myself, i'd rather live among pigs.
come on, tommy, no disputing.
so your first fair since france?
what do you know about france? you war-shy, gypsy bastard.
- so this is the horse?
- and that's the car.
hang on a minute.
you're not swapping the family car for a bloody horse.
of course we're not swapping it.
huh? that'd be mad.
we're gonna play two up.
- here you are.
- yeah, i knew it.
see, i knew it. tommy, you bloody idiot.
shut up, arthur, i won.
oi!
i promised johnny i'd let him have a spin in the car if he lost.
all right.
are you lee boys laughing at my brother?
are ya?
- eh?
- tommy! tommy, come on!
- i asked you a question.
- tommy, come on, it's just the craic.
get your family out of here, and go and enjoy yourselves at the fair before they start a war. huh?
yeah, but his mum was a didicoy whore.
we will take them before last night's beer turns to piss and wakes the devils up.
we will leave no stone unturned.
every gun, every bullet will be brought to me for inspection.
now, take your positions.
freddie...
are you sure your brothers are at the fair?
if it was them, they wouldn't knock.
mr thorne!
what is it?
the police are rounding up the communists.
come on, ada. if the cops find me, we're screwed. fuck!
ada.
you have to jump, ada. i'll catch ya.
come on.
look at this.
a prescription for iron tablets for ada fucking shelby.
mrs donovan, i need that favour.
- come in and be quick.
- i'm not coming in. she is.
holy jesus! it's the shelby girl.
you've not seen her with me, okay, mrs donovan?
just give her a cup of tea and let her stay until the police are gone.
she's the sister of those peaky blinder devils.
and, yet, she's an angel. come on, ada.
what are you gonna do, freddie?
me? i'm gonna have to leave town for a bit.
a gentleman would take off his hat.
put out his pipe.
i see you specials only dare come here when you know the boys are away at the fair.
you mean your nephews?
with their guns and their razors? is it them you're lighting candles for?
no.
i'm lighting candles for the boys from the garrison who lost their lives in france.
there's a list there.
look.
i hear you didn't make it to france,
inspector campbell.
you've heard of me?
i've heard of you.
is it the holy grail you're looking for?
as a matter of fact, it is the holy grail i'm looking for.
something precious, something stolen. perhaps you know what i'm talking about.
sorry. i misunderstood your intention when you pushed me against the wall.
turn the place upside down.
arthur shelby said you people would help us.
if we don't know what you've lost, how can we help you find it?
but i have found out subsequently that i was speaking to the wrong man.
next time, i want to talk to the boss.
lickey tea rooms. friday, 10:00.
and when i say "the boss," i mean thomas.
come on.
now what the bloody hell's been going on here?
jesus christ.
the coppers told everyone arthur had agreed to it when he was arrested.
they said the peaky blinders had cleared out to the fair to let them do it.
no one never said nothing to that copper about smashing up bloody houses!
all right. which pubs did they do?
the guns, the chain, the marquis.
all the ones that pay you to protect them.
the only one they didn't touch was the garrison.
made sure people think we were in on it.
smart, this copper.
so go on. drink your beers. get out.
you better show people you'll still the cocks of the walk.
hand out some cash to the landlords of the pubs.
pay some veterans to fix the places up.
give us the bag.
so what about you, tommy?
i've to go to charlie's to stable the horse.
looked foot sore in the box.
let them see your faces.
so we both know what they were looking for.
you don't read the papers?
racing papers.
so let me tell you the odds.
i reckon it's 3-to-1 there'll be a revolution.
i wouldn't bet on that.
that copper's betting on it.
he's not gonna let it rest till he gets those guns back.
did he talk to ya, pol?
in the church.
did he try to find our ada?
she was sleeping.
where was she sleeping, pol?
i thought you didn't care for women's business.
he knows you're the boss.
he wants to meet you.
- will you talk to him?
- no.
you don't parlay when you're on the back foot.
we'll strike a blow back first.
hey, lad.
- what are you doing?
- we're having a fire.
take off your picture of the king.
what?
bring it to watery lane.
chuck them on, boys.
yeah!
well, i hope to god you know what you're doing.
i'm the reporter.
<i>the birmingham evening despatch.</i>
i had a phone call.
someone called thomas shelby?
come with me.
move aside. give us a bit of room. tommy.
move back for us, please, folks.
you're mr shelby?
- all the way back, please.
- i am.
you said i would be protected.
you're protected.
what's going on?
there are some things i want you to write down.
now, first of all.
it's not the people around here that are disloyal to the king.
it's the opposite.
you see, we don't want our beloved king looking down and seeing the things that have been done to us.
so we are taking down his pictures.
but why are you burning them?
we went through hell for our king.
walked through the flames of war. write all this down!
and now we're being attacked in our own homes.
these new coppers over from belfast, breaking into our homes and interfering with our women.
we don't think our king would want to see that happening.
so we are lighting fires to raise the alarm.
may i ask you, in what capacity do you speak?
no capacity.
i'm an ordinary man.
i won gallantry medals at the somme.
i want you to write in your paper what's going on here.
go on, go.
come in.
there... there...
there's a telephone call for you, sir, on the london line.
there is? it's almost midnight.
it's mr winston churchill, sir.
- yes, sir.
- inspector campbell.
i hear there's been a bonfire in your city.
there was a small fire reported around 9:00 in watery lane.
<i>certainly nothing to trouble you about, sir.</i>
ah, but i'm afraid it has troubled me.
half an hour ago, i received a wire communication from <i>the editor</i> of <i>the birmingham evening despatch.</i>
<i>it seems one of his reporters was invited to the fire</i>
<i>and discovered that they were burning pictures of the king.</i>
of the king?
any newspaper report which may cause embarrassment to his majesty is always referred first, and as a matter of routine, to the home office.
i will go down there immediately, and, er, arrest those involved.
no, you most certainly will not make arrests.
<i>if there are arrests, there will be trials.</i>
if there are trials, there will be more newspaper reports which will necessarily mention the burning of the king's likeness.
i put you in birmingham for one very specific reason.
are you any nearer to finding those stolen guns?
- we are making steady progress.
- we need results.
goodnight, mr campbell.
<i>sir... could i at least ask...</i>
does this report name any of those involved?
it names a mr thomas shelby.
the report mentions he's a war hero.
good of you to join us.
- where have you been all day?
- in bed.
couldn't sleep. then i couldn't wake up.
then i was cold, and then i had to go for a wee.
then i was with this bear on a boat.
that was just a dream. then i was hungry.
why are you reading the paper?
why wouldn't i be?
well, i've never seen you read the paper.
i've only ever seen you light fires with them.
the bsa on strike. miners are on strike.
ira are killing our boys.
ten a day.
what?
stand up.
- why? -just stand up.
side on.
oi, what are you doing?
ada, how late are you?
one week.
five weeks.
seven, if you count weekends. i think it's a lack of iron.
i got some tablets.
but they didn't work.
no.
you can get dressed now, love.
so, am i or not?
keep bloody walking, ada. if anybody sees us here, they'll know.
i'm not getting rid of it, aunt pol.
just come home and we'll talk about it.
you get off of me, or i'll scream it, i swear.
all right, you want to do this on the street? let's do it.
whose is it?
if i tell you, you'll tell them and they'll cut him to pieces.
not if he marries you, they won't.
will he marry you?
i don't know. i don't know where he is.
jesus christ, ada!
look, he's gone away but he said he'd come back.
yeah, but they all say they'll come back.
he's not like that, he's a good man, he promised.
he will come back, aunt pol, i know he will.
get me down a spanish saddle, joe.
yes, tom. a spanish saddle... he's a beauty, tom.
yeah, yeah... beautiful. yeah.
fine beast you got there, thomas.
but is he worth falling out with the lee family over?
just passing it on.
declaration of war. the whole lee clan.
the guns and now this.
the guns are not spoken of.
right?
tommy. tommy!
you mind how to speak to me.
forgive me, uncle.
it's thomas shelby against the whole bloody world, right?
easy! easy!
easy, boy.
shh. in france, we used to say...
shh. in france we used to say it's just the musical hall band turning up.
shh. it's just trombones and tubas, that's all.
it's just noise. shh. shh. shh.
it's just noise, all right? it's just noise.
you get used to it.
it's just noise. good boy.
good boy.
in some pain there, boy, eh?
i... i'm so sorry, mr shelby.
- i'm grace, by the way.
- i know who you are.
what's his name?
he doesn't have a name.
poor boy, deserves a name.
do you have something to say to me?
the other night you came into the pub when i was singing.
you said singing wasn't allowed.
i'd like there to be one night a week when there's singing.
i think it would be good for everyone.
saturday nights.
harry was too afraid to ask you so...
but you're not?
i am.
but i love to sing.
you sound like one of those rich girls who comes over from dublin for the races.
do you like horses?
how'd you fancy earning some extra money?
doing what?
dig out a nice dress.
i want to take you to the races.
go a couple of charges coming in, john. rock ferry down two-eighths.
sorry, mr shelby. go on!
- all right, mr shelby. how's it going?
- hello, frank. how's the leg?
- not bad.
- good.
nice to see you, son.
morning, charlie.
the odds are good, boss.
- how are we looking?
- looking good, tommy.
tom my? tom my?
they're all here for monaghan boy.
that's what i like to hear, johnny boy.
and aunt pol wants to see ya.
tell me the man's name, ada.
rudolph valentino.
get out!
all of you.
go on. now!
i said tell me his fucking name.
freddie fucking thorne!
yeah. your best mate since school, the man who saved your life in france.
so, go on. go and cut him.
cut him up and chuck him in the cut.
oi! i'm a shelby, too, you know!
put my fucking film back on.
so monaghan boy finally lost?
third time unlucky.
we took money from all over the city.
yeah, but you'll pay it back to people round here.
buy your popularity back.
already done.
taught you well.
and you fixed this race without the permission of billy kimber?
obviously didn't teach you well enough!
rule one. you don't punch above your weight.
- billy kimber is there for the taking.
- says who?
says tom and his parliament of one.
- i ran this business for five years.
- yeah.
while i was away fighting, remember?
where i learned some things, such as you strike when the enemy is weak.
and i thought you came here to talk family business.
i'll deal with it. you're too busy taking over the world.
polly.
it's about ada. i need to know.
ada wants you to give freddie this letter.
she wants freddie to know she's having his baby.
he deserves an opportunity to do the right thing.
i say we give them a chance.
for a woman who's had a hard life of men, you're still full of romance, eh?
what do you think freddie sees in our ada?
- that's freddie's business.
- no.
no, i'll tell you what he sees.
he sees machine guns and rifles and ammunition and some glorious revolution.
what is it you really don't like about freddie?
she'll have no life with a man on the run.
if you can't see that, you can't see much.
damn them for what they did to you in france!
tell ada freddie went to america.
or russia.
polly, it'd do no good for ada to bring a baby into the world alone.
pol, listen. the truth is you would've hit me with that thing if it weren't for the fact that you know i'm right!
thought i heard someone knocking.
couldn't get back to sleep.
the longer you leave it, the worse it gets.
believe me.
i know.
i was 16.
and i didn't dare tell anyone.
polly, freddie'll come back.
in the end, i did it myself.
i did it to myself.
and i almost died.
and he didn't come back.
they don't. why should they?
you know the words.
you're a whore. baby's a bastard.
but there's no word for the man who doesn't come back.
one day, on your wedding day, you'll have a good man on your arm.
and you'll say, "polly,
"thank you,
"for common sense."
this woman's in cardiff.
we'll take the train tomorrow.
go to the castle afterwards for a treat.
i chose this place because it is outside both of our jurisdictions.
do you want tea?
inspector, i responded to your invitation because i want us to understand each other.
i'm a businessman.
i want to make my business successful.
and i want my city run peacefully.
well, if the city is peaceful, business can thrive.
so we're on the same side.
i think perhaps we could be.
my...
how can we be on the same side when i see things like this?
my men found this in the bedroom of a known communist.
it has your sister's name on it.
it was obvious she'd been sleeping in his bed.
are you also in bed with the communists, mr shelby?
i do not share their fantasy.
and as for my sister,
i've already dealt with the situation.
freddie thorne is at the very top of my list.
well, cross him off.
he won't be returning to the city.
i'll make him part of our deal.
what deal?
you and your specials will leave my businesses alone from now on.
no more raids into our territory, no more smashing our pubs.
no more lifting my runners.
you will turn a blind eye to all of my gambling operations. also,
i am planning an expansion onto the race tracks.
i intend to do business with billy kimber.
he runs most of the legal trackside betting outside of london.
he has policemen on his payroll.
i want you to put in a word with the chief inspector of gloucestershire, that his men should leave me alone when i make my move.
forgive me, i don't seem to have a pen to write down this rather long list of demands.
and what do i get in return?
i have what you're looking for.
i have the guns.
what guns?
- i'm not here to play games.
- wait, wait...
twenty five lewis machine guns. fifty carbines.
ten thousand rounds of ammunition.
all in a crate bound for libya.
stolen from the bsa factory proofing bay.
i'm guessing they sent you to birmingham to get those guns back.
well, it's me that has them.
i have left word with men i trust, that if i am taken into police custody for whatever reason, those guns will be shipped to liverpool.
from there, they will be sent directly to belfast.
and sold to the irish republican army.
all your good work in ireland will be undone.
each stolen weapon is numbered and marked.
if i sell them to the ira, it won't be long before mr churchill finds out.
i imagine you got into enough trouble over the burning of the king's photographs.
that was just a taster.
if those guns reach belfast, your life in the force is over.
when i have achieved what i have set out to achieve,
i will let you know where to find the guns.
you'll be a hero.
you'll probably get a medal.
i'm a fair man.
it's a fair offer.
do we have a deal?
i need an answer.
right now.
very well.
but i'd prefer if we don't shake hands on it.
now, why would i shake the hand of a man who didn't even fight for his country?
grace.
i have new information.
thomas shelby is now the beginning, the middle and the end of your mission.
so what shall i do?
it hurts me as much as it...
as it would a father sending his own daughter into a whorehouse.
but no matter how repugnant it may be, you must do everything you can to get close to him.
<i>and...</i>
<i>find out where those guns are hidden.</i>
of course, when i say everything, i don't mean...
you underestimate me in every way.
here.
you are now active on a military operation on behalf of the crown.
and i wish to god circumstance hadn't chosen you.
it's what i'm trained for.
i'm late for my shift.
grace, my heart is with you.
ahhh!
tom! tom! tom!
you'd better come quick, tom! tom!
curly, tell me.
cursed, tom.
curly, curly... shh. shh. shh. curly, curly.
tell me. tell me, curly. what's wrong with the horse?
you bought at the fair in bad feeling.
the lees put a bad seed in the hoof and got an old woman to put a spell.
so those lee bastards cursed him.
whatever it is, he says it spread to the other feet.
it's going to his heart by tomorrow, i say!
i've seen curses like this twice. can't take them back, tom.
no.
i told you, tommy.
better enemies to have than black blood gypsies.
get out.
get out, curly.
i'm sorry.
we're closed, mr shelby.
just get me a drink.
shall i leave you alone?
came here for company.
where's harry?
he took the night off.
went to the pictures.
how's your beautiful horse?
i just put a bullet in his head.
was he lame?
he looked at me the wrong way.
it's not a good idea to look at tommy shelby the wrong way.
- what a waste.
- yeah.
a waste is what it is.
you know, in france...
in france, i got used to seeing men die.
never got used to seeing horses die.
they die badly.
i dug out a dress like you asked.
thanks.
it's cheltenham you're talking about.
cheltenham's a grand affair, is it not?
the king will be there.
- king george?
- no.
king billy kimber. and all his men.
and what must i do?
for £2, you'll do what i ask you to do.
i want three.
if i'm meeting a king, i won't be wearing a cheap dress.
and i ask you to let me sing.
it's part of the deal now, too.
since when?
since you nearly smiled.
saturday nights. open and easy.
everyone gets to sing their song, just like we did in dublin.
you never worked in dublin.
so don't lie to me.
i asked around about that pub you said you used to work in.
i have friends over there.
no one has heard of you.
my guess is, you're a girl from a good family who got herself pregnant.
it's not something i want known.
and bringing a child into the world alone ruined your life.
right?
so i'm right.
and polly is wrong.
right about what?
doesn't matter.
looks like it matters to you.
family business.
you won't tell anyone my secret?
do you think i tell people things?
so what do you sing?
- anything you want.
- right.
get up on the chair.
okay.
happy or sad?
sad.
okay. but i warn you, it'll break your heart.
already broken.
<i># in a neat little town they call belfast</i>
<i># apprenticed to a trade i was bound</i>
<i># many an hour's sweet happiness</i>
<i># had i spent in that neat little town</i>
<i># a sad misfortune came over me</i>
<i># which caused me to stray from the land</i>
<i># far away</i>
<i># from my friends and relations</i>
<i># betrayed</i>
<i># by the black velvet band</i>
<i># her eyes they shone like diamonds</i>
<i># i thought her the queen of the land</i>
<i># and her hair hung over her shoulder</i>
<i># tied up</i>
<i># with a black velvet band #</i>
- you okay?
- yeah, i'm fine.
i think there are some more carriages over there that are gonna be empty.
jesus.
freddie.
you came back?
i got a tip-off.
freddie, tommy will kill you.
it's tommy who tipped me off.
maybe he's got half a heart, after all.
tommy got a message to me.
said, "get out of town. take her with you."
so...
ada shelby, will you marry me?
yes.
yes.
yes!
right. get on this bloody train and get out of here.
- come on, both of you.
- freddie, come on.
freddie... cardiff's okay, anywhere but here's okay.
we're not going anywhere, ada.
we're gonna stay here, we're gonna marry here.
i'm not afraid of tommy shelby.
did you want whisky as well?
no, just beer.
why no whisky, tom. you expecting trouble?
jesus christ, tommy, what the hell made you let them sing?
they sound like they're strangling cats out there.
all right. twenty's the play, come on.
now, what did make you change your mind though, tommy? hmm?
- it's about time, tommy.
- time for what?
well...
- time you took yourself a woman. -just play the bloody hand.
you stay the way you are, tommy.
remember what dad used to say.
- fast women and slow horses...
- will ruin your life.
- coppers.
- no.
<i># come, josephine, in my flying machine</i>
<i># going up, she goes</i>
<i># up she goes</i>
<i># balance yourself like a bird on a beam</i>
<i># in the air she goes</i>
<i># there she goes... #</i>
holy shit!
it's billy kimber.
is there any man here named shelby?
i said, "is there any man here named shelby?"
harry, get these men a drink.
everyone else go home.
you go home.
- but mr fenton said...
- i said go home.
i've never approved of women in pubs but when they look like that...
you said you want men called shelby.
you've got three of them.
right, i never heard of ya. and then i did hear of ya, some little didicoy razor gang. i thought to meself, so what?
but then you fucked me over.
so now you have my undivided attention.
by the way, which one am i talking to? who's the boss?
- well, i'm the oldest.
- ha! clearly.
are you laughing at my brother?
right. he's the oldest. you're the thickest.
i'm told the boss is called tommy, and i'm guessing that's you,
'cause you're looking me up and down like i'm a fucking tart.
i want to know what you want.
there were suspicious betting patterns at kempton park.
a horse called monaghan boy...
he won by a length twice and then finished last.
with £3,000 bet on him.
which one am i talking to?
- which one of you is the boss?
- i'm mr kimber's adviser and accountant.
and i'm the fucking boss, okay? right. end of parlay.
you fixed the race without my permission.
you fucking gypsy scum!
what, live off the war pensions and these poor old garrison lane widows?
that's your level. i am billy kimber! i run the races and you fixed one of them. so i'm gonna have you shot against the post.
mr kimber.
look at it.
that has my name in it.
it's from the lee family.
you are also at war with the lees, mr kimber, am i right?
the lees are attacking your bookies and taking your money.
your men can't control them. you need help.
perhaps we should listen to what mr shelby has to say, before we make our decisions.
right. the lees are doing a lot of talking at the fairs.
they have a lot of kin.
they're saying the racetracks are easy meat because the police are busy with strikes. now, we have connections. we know how they operate.
you have muscle.
together we can beat them. divided, maybe not.
mr kimber, perhaps we should take some time for reflection.
possibly make arrangements for a second meeting.
i admire you, mr kimber.
you started with nothing and built a legitimate business.
it would be an honour to work with you, mr kimber.
nobody works "with" me. people work "for" me.
pick it up, pikey.
sit. sit down.
it's for your ceiling.
thank you, mr kimber.
we will be at cheltenham.
as will i.
so you picked a fight with the lee's on purpose.
tommy, we can't mess with billy fucking kimber.
get yourself a decent haircut, man.
we're going to the races.
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track #</i>
<i>i intend to do business with billy kimber.</i>
is there any man here named shelby?
<i>i'm planning an expansion onto the racetracks.</i>
it would be an honour to work with you, mr kimber.
nobody works "with" me. people work "for" me.
<i>danny, you're a good man and a good soldier.</i>
yes, sergeant major.
freddie thorne is at the very top of my list.
well, cross him off. he won't be returning to the city.
<i>thorne". we're not going anywhere, ada.</i>
we're gonna stay here, we're gonna marry here, with our baby.
<i>i'm not afraid of tommy shelby.</i>
thomas, you sell those guns to anyone who has use to them, you will hang.
<i>polly". dump them somewhere the police can find them.</i>
no.
thomas shelby is now the beginning, the middle and the end of your mission.
so what shall i do?
<i>campbell". you must do everything you can to get close to him.</i>
dig out a nice dress, i want to take you to the races.
i warn you, i'll break your heart.
already broken.
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track</i>
<i># where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom</i>
<i># as it shifts and cracks</i>
<i># where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires</i>
<i># hey man, you know you're never coming back #</i>
morning, sir.
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand #</i>
give me a bottle of whisky and three glasses, please.
- scotch or irish?
- irish.
i've decided not to go to the races.
not unless you give me another two pound ten shilling towards the dress.
i've already given you three.
how much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?
oh, i don't pay for suits. my suits are on the house.
or the house burns down.
so, you want me to go looking like a flower girl?
what i want makes no difference.
it's not me you're dressing up for.
you'll forgive me, mr shelby, if i indulge a little bit?
please.
it takes a lot for a man from sparkbrook to step inside this pub.
anyone with money and good intentions is welcome at the garrison.
now, you said you had business.
it's delicate, mr shelby.
it's a question of who knows what about what.
concerns the factory down the road at the bsa.
now, as you might know, most of the paint shop there is irish.
big old place like that, rumours get started.
rumours that there was a robbery.
robbery of what?
guns, mr shelby.
a serious amount of guns.
and what business is that of mine?
when it comes to speculation, you can't beat a factory night shift.
some say there was word from the proofing bay it was the peaky blinders that took them.
your night shift must be dreaming.
- maybe they are.
- maybe they're not.
what we're trying to say is, mr shelby, that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items, we'd pay good money.
- you have good money?
- we have the collections from the pubs.
- for who do you speak?
- the people of ireland.
the irish republican army.
- for a fact?
- for a fucking fact.
you think we're jokers?
am i laughing?
<i># oh, father, why are you so sad</i>
<i># on this bright easter morn #</i>
maguire, will you shut up?
<i># when irishmen are proud and glad</i>
<i># of the land where they were born #</i>
maguire, away and shite. we're trying to talk business here.
<i># oh, son, i see sad memories view</i>
<i># of far-off distant days</i>
<i># when, being just a boy like you,</i>
<i># i joined the ira #</i>
bravo.
<i># where are the lads who stood with me #</i>
all right, boys.
<i># when history was made #</i>
if i hear anything about who know what about what, i'll let you know.
<i># i long to see the boys of the old ira #</i>
i thought you only allowed singing on saturday.
whisky's good proofing water.
tells you who's real and who isn't.
and what did my countrymen want?
oh, they're nobodies.
they drink in the black swan in sparkbrook.
they're only rebels because they like the songs.
you have sympathies with them?
i have no sympathies of any description.
their accents are so thick, it's a wonder you could understand them.
next time, i could translate.
you would work for me?
i thought i already was.
so you are coming to the races.
two pounds, ten shillings.
ten shillings.
buy something red.
to match his handkerchief.
whose handkerchief?
ada, what the hell?
i dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.
- are you mad?
- yeah.
mad as hell with all of them.
i love you.
i love you, too.
the more they try and stop us, the madder i'll be.
- come on, princess. the vicar's waiting.
- wait.
how do i look?
like an angel.
moss, what do we know about the black swan?
an operative has provided intelligence and it is a place where ira men gather.
it's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir.
the ira wouldn't go near them.
then why are two of them looking to buy guns?
do you have names?
must she do everything for you?
she, sir?
one female operative has proved more useful than any of you great lumps of men.
we are regular police officers, sir, not spies.
we can only act when a crime has been committed.
perhaps i should send some men down to the black swan to ask questions.
and scare them all into hiding?
not the best of tactics, sergeant.
my tactics come from my experiences in france.
most of my great lumps of men served in france too, sir.
i serve my country every day.
that'll be all, sergeant.
away and shite.
fancy me, do you?
what are you?
copper?
proddie bitch!
i've seen you. i've seen your face serving at the garrison.
come here.
i'm taking you in for interrogation.
on behalf of the irish free state.
all right?
are you armed?
no.
then i'll tell you.
ada and freddie thorne were married today.
they defied your orders.
they haven't left the city.
i'll deal with it.
thomas.
i'll deal with it.
where are they?
freddie's comrades have safe houses. why do you want to know?
i want to send them flowers. why do you think?
would it be so bad if they stayed?
i promised i'd run freddie out of town.
promised who?
i told the coppers freddie wouldn't come back.
- it was part of the deal.
- what bloody deal?
what happened to family votes? what happened to meetings?
if you let me deal with ada and freddie, it'll end in peace.
christ knows you've had your fill of war.
you get freddie out of town, pol.
or else i'll deal with it myself.
the victim had been drinking in the black swan pub, sir.
the pub that you told me about.
and the neighbour said that she saw a young woman leaving the street where the body was found.
a woman, sir.
i was wondering if there was a connection.
a connection with what, sergeant?
you said that your spy was a woman, sir.
i wondered if there was now a policy.
shoot to kill.
like there was in belfast.
republicans are famously factional.
he was killed by one of his own.
that'll be all, sergeant.
and they're not called spies.
they're called operatives.
operatives, sir. right, sir.
it's how you say things.
yeah.
what the bloody hell is she doing here?
200 pounds, freddie.
for what?
for us.
for a honeymoon that goes on forever.
- where did it come from?
- family fund.
pockets of widows and desperate men.
see sense, freddie.
tommy's not gonna let this rest.
times like these, communists in the family is bad for business.
you have to leave the city.
you think i can't handle tommy shelby?
you can't. i'm having trouble these days and i'm twice the man you are.
i went into town.
the cunard office.
i booked you both tickets for the next boat from liverpool to new york.
america, freddie.
they've already had their revolution. you won't have to bother.
would you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?
you had no business.
observe and report, that is your remit.
i decided we needed to know where he lived.
i warned you not to let your...
your personal history cloud your judgement.
you went after him because he was ira.
i followed him because i thought he might have information.
according to the rules, i should pull you out of garrison lane immediately.
no.
cheltenham's tomorrow.
you take too much upon yourself.
this is an "active military mission".
your words.
i'm doing my job.
grace, the death of a base fenian doesn't concern me.
your welfare does.
killing a man affects the heart.
and as for my heart...
i know that, because of our family connections, you take my progress personally.
but i don't need you to be my father.
i will be thinking of you.
mr shelby, sir?
mr zhang.
that suit is sold, sir. it's being collected this morning.
i know.
please, gentlemen, no fighting in here.
it's all right. i come as a friend.
you're collecting your suit for cheltenham. it's very nice.
how the bloody hell do you know?
i know a lot of things, mr kimber.
and as i told you before, i know the lee brothers.
and i know they're gonna be at the cheltenham races as well.
yes, well they're gonna lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.
no. they're planning on showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies, running chalk and rafflers.
you think i can't handle the lees?
just a word of warning from a friend. that's all.
i'll see you at cheltenham.
i'll wave at you from my box.
if you're coming to the races, bring that pretty barmaid of yours.
already invited.
come on, freddie. comrades.
comrades, as you know, to even gather like this today is illegal.
chief inspector campbell has ordered that we're not allowed to assemble in groups of more than three people.
so, to comply with the law, please now clump together in groups of three.
do you hear that, boys?
the same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top they now blow to try and break us up.
so before the specials get in, raise your hands all those who want to strike.
now disperse.
disperse and take the message home.
united, we will never be defeated.
yes! yes!
tommy. oi, tommy.
what the hell's being happening?
the police have just raided a rally at the factory.
we're thinking freddie thorne's back.
i know he is, and he's with ada.
how hard can it be to find the only girl in birmingham with four-inch heels, eh?
she's with the commies.
they have little rat holes all over the city.
just wanna know where she is.
tommy, you'd best have a word with arthur as well.
what's wrong with bloody arthur?
he's got the flanders blues again.
people keep asking me questions that i don't know the answer to.
is it true your ada got married?
i say, "i don't know."
"where is she living then?"
"i don't know."
"arthur,
"who killed the paddy from the black swan?"
i go, "what paddy?"
they say,
"is it you peaky blinders
"who stole the guns
"from the bsa?"
what guns, tommy?
arthur, after your beating, i thought you needed a break.
what bloody guns, tommy?
arthur, i was gonna tell you.
you were gonna tell me?
arthur, listen to me.
you've had a hard time these past few years. god knows you have.
you deserve some rest.
we had some luck.
some bloody luck.
it fell off a wagon into our laps.
and all you need to know is, it's us that has the machine guns now.
and it's them that's in the mud.
all right?
come on.
i have a surprise for you.
come on.
surprise.
where is she?
what is it you've always wanted, arthur?
eh?
when we were in france, you used to say,
"when i go back to england, i want to own my own pub."
well.
now you've gone soft.
you've gone soft, tommy.
how do we know it's for sale?
everything is for sale to us, arthur.
we're making a lot of money these days.
we need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.
i wouldn't know what to do.
you spent two-thirds of your life in pubs, just pour it.
instead of drinking it.
but i can still drink it though, right?
your pub, you do what you want.
ah. sorry, gentlemen.
didn't hear you come in.
what can i get you?
bloody kids.
think the other one's punctured as well.
mr campbell wants an explanation.
today, some rebel-rousing union man brought the bsa out on strike.
freddie thorne.
i thought you promised he wouldn't come back.
i know he's in town.
i'm dealing with it.
mr campbell thought that you controlled these territories.
yeah.
i said i'm dealing with it.
i heard that, er,
freddie married your sister.
some family you've got, eh?
bet you can't wait for christmas.
deliver freddie thorne to us, or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice.
she'll get four years for sedition.
or you can turn him in.
and your sister goes free.
i'll say goodnight then, tom.
have you seen freddie thorne?
- no.
- or tommy?
- we have to find freddie.
- drink this first.
no, we have to find them. i think they're gonna kill each other.
wait. who's going to kill who?
we need to talk.
what exactly is it that you want, freddie?
i came to tell you.
that's not gonna work, tommy.
polly came round.
she gave me that.
well,
polly must've had a rush of blood.
or port wine.
your honesty is appreciated. now, if you're not gonna use that thing...
i'm not finished!
sit down.
sit down. sit!
talk to me about the guns.
do you remember we used to jump in here and see who could swim across...
i'm here to talk business, tommy.
do you reckon we could still do it?
you loaded ada with your bastard because she's a shelby.
you thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.
i won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.
my god, you actually believe that?
i love her, tommy.
i've loved her since she was nine and i was twelve.
she loves me the same.
do you even know the word?
this marriage will not stand.
shh.
freddie didn't want your money.
and now the coppers are saying that if we don't turn freddie in, they'll put ada on the arrest warrant as well.
that's where your compassion gets you, pol.
from now on, we do it my way.
or what?
freddie?
<i>tommy". are you getting closer?</i>
i'll lead.
watch yourself, danny. tommy.
<i>tommy". be careful, danny.</i>
shh, shh.
tommy!
tommy!
tommy.
tommy. tommy.
it's open.
private whizz-bang reporting, sir.
at ease.
so, what news from london?
i was in a pub.
it was called the mother red cap. an irish pub.
i got talking to some old bloke about birmingham.
he said there's been trouble.
an ira man shot.
he said a lot, but the only bit i heard was that their high command think it's the peaky blinders who shot him.
i came up on the next boat to warn you.
is it true?
no.
- but lies travel faster than the truth.
- hmm.
get a message to them.
tell 'em to send someone to parlay.
tell 'em there's been a misunderstanding and we don't want any trouble.
you've got enough trouble, right, tommy?
the whisky and the smoke.
i can smell it in the air.
use it sometimes myself.
call it my sweetheart.
they gave us the worst job, tommy.
yeah...
and we fucking volunteered.
sometimes it lasts all night.
and i lie here and i listen to the shovels...
and the picks against that wall there.
and i pray the sun will come up with the curtains before they break through.
<i>tommy". no, i don't pray.</i>
<i>i hope.</i>
<i>but sometimes it happens.</i>
<i>the sun beats them.</i>
<i>but mostly...</i>
<i>the shovels beat the sun.</i>
your sister was here.
she was worried you and freddie...
it had made her sick.
she's all right, but in her condition she needs peace.
women talk.
that is something they do.
she talked about you.
she said you keep everything locked up.
well...
that's what men do.
your sister's nice. i like her.
can't be easy for her.
her brother and her husband fighting over the same thing.
men should talk too.
to you?
why not?
i'm a barmaid. it's my job.
men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.
what is it you and freddie are fighting over?
i'll meet you here at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
did you buy a dress?
yes, i bought a dress.
how does it look?
he's changed the oil and greased her up.
so will it get me all the way to cheltenham, curly?
he's good with motors but it pains him.
no heart in motor cars. i can't talk to them.
yeah... tommy might need to make a fast getaway.
the lees will be all over the track.
and kimber's men.
and his coppers, they control the law down there, tommy.
give 'er a turn for me, charlie.
this car only seats four.
you'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.
but it's just me and the girl.
is it just the two of us going to the races?
something like that.
attention!
right.
this is what's known as your final briefing before going over the top.
sixty miles down that road is cheltenham race track.
johnny, what's our mission, boy?
to stick it to the lee family, arthur!
that's right.
the lees are skimming money off legal bookies, running chalk, selling rafflers.
and beating up them as won't buy.
but, today...
- we're gonna stop them.
- what about kimber's men?
thought he had his own protection.
kimber's let his troops go rotten.
they're on the take from the lees to look the other way.
we're gonna show kimber how it should be done.
now take what you're good at.
those of you with guns, keep them out of it unless a gun is pulled on you. we want this done quietly.
so when do we share out the cash?
we don't. we're not keeping the cash.
you're in tommy's army now, boys.
trust only kin.
let's go.
what stable's he? number seven, isn't it?
are you sure we're allowed in here?
well, i prefer to come to the races the back way.
keeps me out of trouble.
tracks are lawless places.
can't stand petty criminals. this way.
will we get to lay a bet?
nah. gambling's for mugs.
this way.
you're lucky you're with me or you'd be wasting your money on fixed races.
i always wondered, how do you fix a race?
how should i know?
- okay. you do the talking.
- what?
tell security you are lady sarah...
excuse us. excuse us.
lady sarah duggan of connemara.
you got lost when you went to look for the boy riding your horse.
uh, dandy flower. if they ask about me, say that i'm prussian.
don't speak a word of english.
come on, posh girl. earn your three quid.
i still prefer the garrison.
do you dance?
if i am asked properly.
lady sarah of connemara, will you dance with me?
roberts, the peaky blinders are here.
told you, mr kimber.
he's got some balls, that one.
and she's got some body, that one.
chalk. for your blackboard.
five pound a stick.
it's a pleasure doing business with you.
hello, reg. how's business?
fucker, get up!
stay still, reg, or i'll take the whole ear off.
and you're gonna need your ears to listen.
no more chalking on billy kimber's boys.
right?
we're the protection now.
i commandeer this stolen money, by order of the peaky blinders.
either your left leg is stronger than your right or we're making a getaway.
hey! neither.
i hope this doesn't involve razor blades.
i've decided to move up in the world.
become a legitimate businessman.
my gosh, you're serious.
i'm always serious.
we chased the lees across the track right the way down the devon road.
we got every penny back.
nice dress.
you can wear that in my pub.
buy the boys a drink. anyone hurt?
ah... a few cuts and bruises.
off we go, lady sarah.
steady on.
excuse me. cheers.
your money, mr kimber.
rescued from the lee brothers and returned to you with a request for a fair hearing.
your own protection is failing, mr kimber.
your boys are taking cuts.
i want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the peaky blinders.
we'd be saving you a lot of money, mr kimber.
lot of money.
in return, you give us...
five percent of the take and three legal betting pitches at every race meeting north of the river severn.
rising to six after one year if we're all satisfied with the service.
what do you say, mr kimber?
i say you talk business to my accountant.
i want a dance.
your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.
how many men can you put in the field at one time?
there's a lot of men out of work at the moment.
two guards for every bookie.
at every meeting.
we have contacts with good people among the gypsies.
we'll always know when the lees plan to attack.
with all the strikes and troubles, can't really depend on the police.
anyway, we're more honest.
looks like you two are making a deal.
we are making progress.
then let me throw a small condition into the mix.
so, listen, uh...
we're gonna go for dinner at kimber's house.
he has a place a couple of miles away.
i have some business to settle first with his accountant, so...
you go on ahead with kimber.
just me and him?
yeah. till i'm done here.
is that all right?
look, i'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time.
you think i'm a whore.
everyone's a whore, grace.
we just sell different parts of ourselves.
you said you wanted to work for me.
to do that you have to sharpen up.
the deal is, i'll give him two hours with you.
he thinks he's a ladies' man.
he thinks he can seduce you.
whenever you want, just kick him in the balls.
i'm a clause in a contract.
if you wanna be part of my organisation, you have to make sacrifices.
do we have a deal? as a sweetener, you can try your luck with mine.
yeah, we have a deal.
- two hours?
- yeah.
side bet,10 pounds says i'll have her fucked in one.
mademoiselle.
i bet he said you could have me, didn't he?
while he has her.
that's the arrangement, isn't it?
yours might be a prostitute, but i'm not.
i was a milliner when i met him.
i was independent.
i made this hat.
i was a good milliner.
it's a very pretty hat.
really is.
so is she a prostitute?
god's honest truth,
i don't know what she is.
you showed me up back there at the races.
why don't you teach me how to dance properly?
the music's too slow. put on a charleston.
well, then we'd be far away. i want to dance like this.
come on, you weren't so stiff back there, were you? hmm?
you ever been in a house this big?
hmm?
mmm. look at you.
you look like a bloody film star.
i want a cigarette.
oh, look, i've dropped something.
pick it up.
- pick it up yourself.
- you're a fucking barmaid.
if i drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up.
i want to watch you pick it up.
right, you little slag.
i tried to be nice. yeah?
if i drop a glass on the floor, you bend over and fucking pick up the fucking glass.
- okay? what?
- no, sir. no.
what are you doing here?
- i've got another hour.
- just wait.
listen to me. just listen to me.
i was going to let you go through with this but, in the end, my conscience got the better of me. she looks good on the outside, but she has the clap.
yeah. syphilis.
when you took a shine to her, i thought i'd use her.
someone told me she had the syph, i thought, "what the hell?"
call it my better nature.
she's, uh, she's a whore.
- well, just go and wait in the car.
- i can walk on my own.
can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?
start of the day, i was lady sarah of connemara.
by the end, i was a whore with the clap.
you're a fucking bastard, offering me like that.
but then you change your mind.
why did you change your mind, thomas?
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track</i>
<i># where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom</i>
<i># as it shifts and cracks... #</i>
when i've achieved what i've set out to achieve,
i will let you know where to find the guns.
so what shall i do?
get close to him. find out where those guns are heading.
raise your hand, all those who want to strike!
freddie thorne is at the very top of my list.
well, cross him off. i'll make him part of our deal.
to hell with them. the more they try and stop us, the madder i'll be.
in times like these, a communist in family is bad for business.
you have to leave the city.
<i>you were also at war with the lees, mr kimber, am i right?</i>
together, we can beat them. divided, maybe not.
god, he's getting big now!
not at all.
<i># where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom</i>
<i># as it shifts and cracks</i>
<i># where secrets lie in the border fires</i>
<i># in the humming wires... #</i>
- so, how was london?
- it was crackling with revolution.
the poplar docks are on strike.
did our friends give us what we asked for?
- how much? -200 pounds.
- who did you meet?
- an attache from the russian embassy.
in a chinese restaurant.
our revolution is international. it grows by the day.
jeremiah, jeremiah, what do you see?
your sister and freddie got back this morning.
i tried following them. but freddie's so good at getting away.
- he's like a fish.
- right.
well, keep fishing, eh?
last bets, now.
now, don't go spending all your rent money, charlie.
that's your starters, gentleman. no more bets.
- i was there on time.
- finished.
- i've had a tip off. i need this bet.
- the race has started...
- please.
- no!
- ugh. fine.
- get rid of him. i said no.
- now get out.
- all right, all right, i'm off. i'm off.
- all right, lads. see you tomorrow.
- cheers.
- it's a good day.
- where's john?
john's in the garrison.
says he wants a meeting about a family matter.
after he's said his piece, he'll come back and take his place with scudboat.
scudboat, john will be here in ten minutes.
- all right.
- five.
we're here.
good boy.
john?
put that down!
this is for cheltenham.
we just taking back what's ours.
there's loot in here, search everywhere!
all right, john. there's only one... not now. only one man guarding the house.
what's troubling you?
polly, you know what it's been like since martha died.
god takes the best first.
the truth is, my kids have been running bloody rings around me.
running barefoot with the dogs until all hours.
pol, give him ten bob for some new shoes. is that it, john?
tommy, we'd be better to do this without you.
now, what's your point?
what the kids need is a mother.
so that's why i'm getting married.
does this poor girl know you're gonna marry her or are you just gonna spring it on her all of the sudden?
i've already proposed.
and she said yes.
i think there's a shell about to land and go bang.
it's, um, it's lizzie stark.
john! lizzie stark's a strong woman, and i'm sure she provides a fine service for her customers.
i won't hear the word.
understand? do not use that word.
what word is that, john?
- you know what word that is.
- everybody bloody knows.
everybody can go to hell.
whore? that word. or prostitute? how about that one?
all right, i want it known, if anyone calls her a whore again,
i will push the barrel of my revolver down their throats, and blow the word back down into their hearts.
men and their cocks never cease to amaze me.
john, lizzie stark never did a day's work vertical.
she's changed. all right, people change.
like with religion.
oh, lizzie stark's got religion, eh?
no, no, she doesn't have religion, but...
well, she loves me.
now, listen, tommy. i won't do it without your blessing.
but of all the people in the world, i want you to see it...
- as brave.
- oh, it's brave, all right.
brave is going where no man has gone before.
and with lizzie stark, john, that is really not what you'll be doing.
give me some time.
welcome her to the family as someone who's had a hard life.
all right, because i need someone.
all right, the kids need someone.
tommy, we've been done over.
what?
jesus christ!
what the bloody hell happened here?
the lees, all of them. cousins, nephews.
even the bastards.
they've taken anything they can lay their hands on.
four cash boxes.
- they left these.
- wire cutters?
- why would they leave wire cutters?
- nobody move.
i think our friends are playing the game.
- what game?
- pol, don't, don't touch anything.
erasmus lee was in france.
shit.
when we gave up ground to the germans, we'd leave behind booby traps set up with wires.
then we'd leave wire cutters.
it's part of the joke.
somewhere in here there's a hand grenade.
holy jesus.
attached to a wire.
don't move any chairs.
or open any doors.
go easy, john boy, easy.
ah!
boys, no, there's nothing here.
if it was in here, it would have blown by now.
it was my name on that bullet erasmus sent.
he set up a trap all right.
he set it upj ust for me.
finn?
finn, stay exactly where you are.
i was pretending i was you.
which door did you open to come in, finn?
i didn't, i climbed in.
i want you to climb out exactly the same way you climbed in, okay?
no, no, finn!
grenade!
that's why you should never pretend to be me.
okay? okay?
i got you ten minutes with her.
you can at least say thank you. it's easier to see the pope, these days.
put your hand on the bible.
i don't believe.
anyway, i didn't come here to lie.
this war is cutting us all up.
- you're all children.
- i say enough.
your boys tried to kill me. didn't work.
no wonder you won't touch a bible.
- i have ambitions.
- you want to play a switch.
- i need your boys.
- for what?
kimber's not the brains, there's a gadza who runs the races.
i'm collecting smart people, but i need strong men, too.
now, your boys should know this.
we now get the winner in one of three races before the race even starts.
no need for chalkers or rafflers, i'm talking certainties.
you come in here, boasting you're gonna do someone down, and in the same breath, ask me to trust you?
on my mother's side, we are kin.
ada, can you do my back?
ada!
i know what was in the envelope.
i looked. money.
and that bloke that we met in london, who you said was a frenchman, he was russian. i'm not an idiot, freddie.
how is it, that you take all the risks and stanley chapman gets the money?
it's money for the cause.
you're blind.
i would be, if your brothers had anything to do with it.
this isn't about them, this is about you. and me.
and this.
you're a dreamer, freddie.
you give money away while we rot in here.
you talk about revolution.
i need to know.
who are you loyal to, freddie?
i said, who are you loyal to?
did you have something to do with this?
i asked an acquaintance for an address.
she said she'd only give it to me anonymously.
she's afraid of the consequences.
whose address is it?
tommy, i'd like to suggest a strategy.
your message said you have an address for me?
anonymous tip off.
the address of stanley chapman.
- you promised me freddie thorne.
- this is instead of freddie thorne.
- no deal.
- inspector,
stanley chapman is a bigger fish than freddie thorne.
he's currently holding £200 in cash given to the communist party by the russian government.
that's right, chapman has snow on his boots.
and all you need is a shovel.
if he talks, you'll have proof.
you might even get that medal.
n ow, before i give you the address,
i want your word that you'll let freddie thorne and my sister leave the city.
very well. you have my word.
i'd say our little truce has proven quite productive for both of us, inspector.
i'll get the information and protection.
and you? well...
you get bolsheviks.
but on a more pressing matter,
i'm afraid that mr churchill is becoming impatient.
and i fear that, if you don't get back those stolen weapons soon,
i will be replaced.
that will be the finish for me, that's for sure.
when my business with kimber is done, the guns will be returned. that was the deal.
then i'm in your hands, completely.
you hold all the cards.
but, i hope to god that my dismissal doesn't come before your decision to hand back those guns.
and i say this for your sake because, if i were to be fired, and it were your fault,
i would do things that would shame the devil.
my fury is a thing to behold.
on my last day in power, for example,
i would see to it that you and your scum brothers have your heads stoved in with mallets and spades.
and your sister, too.
that baby inside her would be of no consequence to me.
the only one to be spared would be your little brother finn.
he would, however, be lifted, as a juvenile, and dumped in that part of the adult prison where men have the most appetite for boys like him.
oh, that would be a dark day indeed, mr shelby, if my dismissal comes before your decision.
you understand?
and know this, the clock is ticking.
look what we found.
seems stanley chapman really does have snow on his boots.
come on. here we go.
mr chapman...
you're fucked.
he still refuses to say where it came from.
i'm sure with a little persuasion he'll tell us everything he knows.
including the whereabouts of freddie thorne.
- sir?
- your face is a picture.
but i thought you'd done a deal.
- oh, is that what you thought?
- well, you gave your word.
my word.
people still talk about such things in this idiotic century.
my word to who?
to a peaky blinder?
now, go on and interrogate mr chapman until he tells us where we can find freddie thorne and his wife.
the source of the money is of secondary importance.
you think my campaign against shelby has become personal?
correct.
spot on, as they say in london society.
now, go and interrogate mr chapman.
and do not make the mistake of being too gentle.
right, sir.
today's her birthday.
i know you never miss it.
then i'm lucky you're not a copper.
- what do you want?
- came to warn you.
they've lifted stanley chapman.
how do you know? police don't spill that information.
i know because it was me and tommy who tipped him off.
tommy did a deal. in return for safe passage for you and ada, he's given them stanley and the money.
money? what money?
- who told you about the money?
- who do you think?
yeah, it was ada's idea.
that's how desperate she is to get out of that rat hole you're keeping her in.
she didn't mind if you knew, just didn't want to be here when you found out.
sometimes women have to take over. like in the war.
who the hell do you think you are? you fucking shelbys!
don't you swear over your mother's grave.
you play your tune, you expect the whole world to dance to it.
you don't have time for this, freddie.
you did a deal for me.
don't flatter yourself. for ada.
and you think this copper will keep his word?
if he does, you're safe. if he doesn't, chapman will give you up.
you'll still have to leave town, same result.
- so neat.
- so leave.
except there's one thing that you've got wrong,
stanley won't be able to give up my address because he doesn't know it.
that's how it works. none of us know each other's addresses.
so you've wasted your fucking time.
and they'll keep beating him and beating him for information he doesn't have.
so all you've done is sign the death warrant of a good man.
- so you won't leave?
- no, i won't fucking leave.
and if you want me out of birmingham, it'll have to be in a wooden box.
you lay a hand on our ada and i'll put you in a wooden box myself.
you raised a stubborn one there, irene.
you told me to carry on.
i wanted to stop.
he had some kind of seizure.
so you killed him.
did he give you an address?
what's the matter with you? he fell down some stairs.
this is not bloody belfast.
not yet, but if men like him get their way, it soon will be.
so find some stairs, throw him down, and call the coroner.
use grayson.
if he has any awkward questions, ask about the welfare of his mistress in saltley.
that'll shut him up.
to think i used to live in a shithole like this.
bloody animals.
the shelbys really are doing an excellent job for us.
we haven't lost a single penny to rafflers or chalkers in eight race meetings.
the bookies are purring.
so we throw the dog a bone.
i think so.
mr kimber, mr roberts, come and have a look around.
after you.
well, i thought the lees turned you over?
you shouldn't listen to gossip, mr kimber. this way.
business is good.
especially since now you know which horse is going to win before you set the odds.
information is very much appreciated.
all right, well, where are they?
john, lovelock. scudboat, in here.
this is my team.
they will take up their pitch at your convenience, mr kimber.
john is the book, scudboat is the bag man, and of course, we bring our own protection.
warwick, next saturday, at least 50 yards from the beer tent.
gentleman, and lady.
i have in my hand a legal betting license, issued by the board of control.
the shelby family has its first, legal racetrack pitch.
congratulations.
there you go.
congratulations.
these cigarettes have a strange smell, arthur.
they smell like rotting water.
and look, rats have got into some of them.
they're stolen, are they not?
don't ask.
they smell because you keep them in the boat.
what do you care? now, can you come check my adding up, please?
you know, you should make a new start of this place.
do it properly-
these cigarettes are not fit to sell.
smells like gallipoli.
you should find a new place to store them.
it has to be far away from coppers.
oh, but not rats.
all the wharves have rats, grace.
what's wrong with a dry warehouse?
tommy's orders.
what orders?
always keep contraband near petrol boat moorings.
don't boats get searched?
we moor them at junctions.
so there's more than one way out.
no locks within a mile so we can move that stuff, fast.
your brother doesn't obey the law, but he has rules.
precise man, your brother.
is my adding up right?
it is now.
one.
two.
three.
<i>and four.</i>
<i>and we'll search them one-by-one.</i>
please, lord, let that which i seek be found here.
not so much as a bullet, sir.
just more cigarettes and whisky.
arthur tells me you've been asking questions.
about how we run our business and how we get our booze and where we keep it.
i'm just trying to help.
let's you and me go for a walk.
where to?
come on.
why here?
you're a good catholic girl, aren't you?
yes.
well, then you know it's here people come to confess.
after you.
well, here it is, grace.
i'll confess.
i need someone.
kimber has an adviser by the name of roberts.
he talks well.
keeps the accounts.
runs the legal side of the business.
and you need a roberts?
arthur tells me you have ideas.
i'm not an accountant, nor a lawyer.
no.
no, but you have something i need.
class.
i need someone who looks right at the big meetings.
epsom, ascot.
is this a job interview?
arthur says you're good with numbers.
oh, well, that's relative. he's quite poor.
you keep the books in order.
they were chaotic.
but you're a liar.
no catholic girl would enter a church and forget to make the sign of the cross.
you're very perceptive.
first, you lied to me about that pub you used to work in.
now i find out you're a protestant.
- do you care?
- no.
i like to fit in.
you pull a pint like someone who's thinking about it.
this is not an interview, this is an interrogation.
sit down.
look, grace.
you've washed up in a place you don't belong, for whatever reason.
my good fortune.
and perhaps mine.
you know that most of what i do is illegal?
i'm not blind.
and yet you'd still be willing to work for me?
are you offering me the job?
then i accept.
there's something else you should know.
a very important detail about my reasons for employing you.
you disappoint me.
you resign?
no.
my appetite for the work has only increased.
tomorrow i'll show you around.
lizzie!
hello, lizzie?
that bag looks heavy. jump in!
it is.
you like kids?
- yeah.
- good, because john's got four of them.
it's all right, i'm not going to try to talk you out of it.
i just want to talk.
then you're against us?
john is his own man.
and you're your own woman.
now, lizzie, since i came back from france, i've come to you on many occasions.
tommy, you didn't tell him?
no, i didn't tell him.
just like you didn't tell him.
now, why didn't you tell him, lizzie?
why didn't you tell him that you've been serving his brother for the past two years?
because the past is the past.
i don't want to lose him. he's a good man.
that was the answer i was hoping you'd give. the past is the past.
you see, our john says you've changed.
and i believe him, and that's good.
change is good.
these are new times i'm told.
so i wish you both every happiness.
and i want you to see that as my wedding gift to you and our farewell to pleasures gone by.
you mean...
one last time?
one last time.
you and me.
it's eight bloody pounds.
so where should we go?
tommy, should we go to my lodging?
so the past is not the past.
you can keep the money, lizzie, just get out of the car.
- tommy, please! -just get out of the car.
i love him, tommy, really.
really.
john will make his own decision.
but he will have the facts.
your brother is ten times the man you are.
of that i have no doubt.
well, he's obviously not stupid.
all we found was stolen tobacco and whisky.
which you left it in place?
of course.
i would never endanger you.
you're doing well, grace.
i've been working on arthur. he's easier.
than thomas?
yes.
less intelligent.
yes.
that's not a word you'd use about thomas.
it's your word.
he has promoted me.
he wants me to be his bookkeeper and secretary.
a cut-throat gangster with a secretary.
the pretensions of these hoodlums are quite breathtaking.
are they not?
yes, quite breathtaking.
he's obviously fallen quite heavily for you.
i thought you'd be pleased.
i just hope you remember who you're dealing with, here.
a man who cuts off ears and cuts out tongues.
i know what he is, sir.
the difficulty with undercover work, grace, is to remember what you are.
i come here with good news and i get this?
grace.
tommy.
i need a favour.
i want to borrow the car.
i want to take lizzie for a ride in the country with the kids.
i'm going to celebrate getting the license.
not a problem,john.
i need the keys.
look, john, you're my brother.
there's something i have to tell you.
yesterday, in the front seat of that ca r,
i offered lizzie some money.
and, john, she said yes.
now that's a fact.
you do with it what you want.
you can take the keys, take lizzie to the country. marry her, if you want.
but you have to know...
she said yes.
get another glass.
can you make a toast?
i'm irish, i can make a million toasts.
may you be in heaven a full half-hour before the devil knows you're dead.
what are we celebrating?
contract of employment.
"bookkeeper, shelby brothers limited."
i don't like that word, "limited".
to be respectable, you have to be limited.
that's what worries me.
i had the phone put in.
it's in the back.
huh. if i knew someone else who had a phone, we could call them.
and since we're celebrating,
i had this delivered from rackhams department store.
will you open it?
no.
save it for a special occasion.
<i>a“ fight, your first 'gob for the company.</i>
i want you to get that to my sister.
you don't see her?
no one does. she's hiding from me.
i was told she goes to a bathhouse on montague street on women-only days.
she goes in disguise so i need to get someone inside.
what am i delivering?
it's an invitation to a family occasion. i want her there.
tell her there'll be a truce.
am i delivering bait for a trap?
if you take that contract,
i think you'll find it doesn't say anything about asking questions.
just give her the invitation.
and put that thing in the cupboard till i say.
bloody hell, john.
i couldn't get it lit. couldn't even do that.
what do you want to be smoking that for?
same reason as you.
pain in the head.
i spoke to lizzie.
told her what you told me.
she said, "your brother tommy is a dirty liar."
and then i spoke to her sister and her cousin.
i bought them a couple of drinks.
just a few regulars, they said.
that's all.
to keep the wolf from the door she still sees a couple of regulars.
you must think i'm an idiot!
i think you're the first shelby in history to have a legal license for anything.
what would our granddad say, eh?
he'd be turning in his grave.
"honest bloody money!
"hey, in this house? here?"
you always used to do voices when we were kids.
well, we're not kids now, john.
but we still have to look out for each other, right?
yeah.
yeah.
come on, go home.
get some sleep.
we've got a big day tomorrow.
we have?
tomorrow, we finish the war with the lees for once and for all.
- since when?
- since just now.
ten o'clock, tomorrow.
be ready for anything.
how do you go, boys?
ready, boys?
<i>eh“, ready?</i>
- yeah. yeah, i'm fine.
- have a drink.
what? what are you all staring at me for?
- what?
- good. let's go.
what?
tommy, what are you playing at? we're at shotgun range.
john, before you go into battle, there's something you're going to need.
what are you bloody doing, tommy?
smile, john. it's a wedding.
whose bloody wedding?
now, if we told you, you wouldn't have come.
there's a girl in the lee family who's gone a bit wild and she needs marrying off.
- ah, fuck!
- john, boy!
- john!
- you have no bloody right, tommy!
shh. shh. listen to me! listen to me!
a girl who needs a husband, a man who needs a wife.
tom, i'm not bloody marrying some fucking mushroom picker..
shh,john boy. come on, listen.
i've already betrothed you.
so if you back out now, there's going to be one fucking mighty war breaking out here that's going to make the somme...
that's going to make the somme look like a fucking tea party.
but if you marry her, our family and the lee family will be united forever and this war will be over.
now, it's up to you, john.
war or peace?
let go of me!
right.
you should see the size of her dowry.
her what?
her dad's giving you a car.
will he do?
he'll do.
here she is.
she'd better be under 50.
come here.
go on.
we're here today to join in matrimony, this man and this woman...
you look well.
and harmony and togetherness which is sanctioned and honoured by the presence and the power of these two families around us.
do you, john michael shelby, take esme martha lee to be your beautiful young wife?
you got my invitation?
grace said there's a truce.
family day.
your husband couldn't make it?
he's not speaking to me.
and when he does he calls me a "fucking shelby" even though i'm a thorne now.
a thorn in my side, that's for sure.
my god, tommy, you admire him, don't you?
there remains one more part of the ceremony.
it's the mingling of the two bloods.
so the two families become the one family.
i now pronounce you man and wife!
well, john, kiss the bride, will you?
and again!
you should tell ada to slow down.
you think she'll listen to me?
i've tried stopping her but she's been drinking.
she's been stuck in that little basement for weeks, what do we expect?
she's going off like a firecracker. oh, christ, tommy, please.
ada, come on, have a rest. sit down.
come and look, esme.
come and look at the family you've joined.
come and look at the man who runs it!
chooses his brothers' wives for them!
he hunts his own sister down like a rat, and he tries to kill his own brother-in-law!
ada, that's enough!
and now he won't even let me have a fucking dance!
- ada!
- not even at a fucking wedding!
- sit her down.
- calm down, ada.
ada, calm down.
holy shit.
water. right.
not now, ada! bloody hell, you do pick your times!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
let's go! whoa.
slow it up, nice and easy.
story of your fucking life. right, we're here.
come on.
nice car,john. how's she run?
yeah, beautiful, really smooth.
your sister's in there giving birth, you're talking about the bloody car.
not much us men can do now, pol.
- except go get drunk.
- right, c'mon.
one man should be here.
you're right, pol.
freddie should be here.
is that a heartbeat i hear inside that chest?
the truce lasts until sunrise.
on my oath. tell freddie it's safe.
ada!
all right, boys, let's wet this baby's head.
keep going. that's right.
push!
i think it might be the wrong way around.
i attended three sisters.
- yeah, i think you're right.
- we should move her forward.
come on, ada.
all right, come on.
it's not long to go now, darling.
push, two, three!
to a beautiful wedding.
i should go.
- i should go soon.
- no, no, no, no.
no, you sit down.
you don't want to be among women when there's a baby coming. have another.
do you think her husband will take the same advice and stay away?
no, no, freddie'll be there.
nothing'll keep him away.
tommy said it's all right for him to be there.
isn't that right, tommy?
that's right. i'm all heart tonight.
you know what, john?
i think it's that lovely barmaid, that pretty barmaid that just walked out, that's made our brother go all soft.
drinks to that!
ada!
come on, open up!
there you go, love.
he's beautiful.
it's a boy, freddie.
it's a beautiful baby boy.
there you go.
welcome to the world, son.
welcome.
open up, police!
freddie?
you can't come in here! there's a baby that's just been born.
freddie! there's a baby!
don't do this here.
don't hurt him! freddie!
you're hurting him! leave him alone!
you're taking me away from my baby.
- ada!
- freddie!
ada!
you want me to open that champagne now?
it's a boy.
whoa, whoa, whoa!
oi, polly! polly!
but the police came and took his father away!
don't you dare look at me like that!
you liar!
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track #</i>
people keep asking me questions that i don't know the answer to.
it's us that has the machine guns now.
and it's them that's in the mud.
guns, mr shelby.
we'd pay good money.
- for who do you speak?
- the irish republican army.
what are you? copper?
you went after him because he was ira.
i followed him because i thought he might have information.
<i>campbell". the difficulty with undercover work, grace,</i>
<i>is to remember what you are.</i>
your sister's in there giving birth, there's one man should be here.
you're right, pol.
on my oath. tell freddie it's safe.
welcome to the world, son.
- freddie!
- ada!
polly! polly!
the police came and took his father away!
you liar!
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track</i>
<i># where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom</i>
<i># as it shifts and cracks</i>
<i># where secrets lie in the border fires</i>
<i># in the humming wires</i>
<i># hey man, you know you're never coming back</i>
<i># past the square, past the bridge</i>
<i># past the mills, past the stacks</i>
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand #</i>
open up, love.
i brought more things for you and the baby.
got some fresh eggs and bread.
shh...
i'll leave it here.
ada, think of the little one.
babies don't have principles.
did you speak to her?
she didn't speak back.
did you tell her?
i'll only tell her what i know to be true.
it's the last time i'm going to say this.
it wasn't me who shot freddie thorne.
tommy,
i'd ask you to swear on the bible but you can't swear on that, can you?
nothing you hold sacred.
there's tea.
a new system.
everything in the diary, eh?
mmm-hmm.
black star.
what does that mean?
black star day... is the day we take out billy kimber and his men.
no one knows this.
not even your family?
grace...
everyone in my family hates me.
why would i tell them?
he's off the bloody rails is what he is.
if he'll turn nose on his best mate.
bloody neighbours, john. snitch behind the curtain.
yeah, well, if you think that, you're the only one who does.
look at this. look.
bloody rakin' it in!
who's running this carny?
name of marsden. intends on wintering in small heath at this ring.
- does he?
- only heard.
nobody in small heath craps in a pot without the decree of tommy almighty.
mr marsden, i believe!
the ring master!
proud i am to say so.
yeah, well, these here are civilised parts.
man wants to set his stall up with fellas lampin' each other.
he needs himself a license.
a license?
for a fee.
from those in charge.
i'll tell you what.
how about i keep my money and you shove a license up your arse crack?
you don't want to speak to me like that.
and who the bloody hell do you think you are?
my name... is arthur shelby!
dad?
jesus.
thank you. you're a good boy.
bless the father for these bounties we're about to receive...
jesus christ.
please, woman.
let me be.
finish your sandwich and sling your hook.
polly anna, i'm a guest of the head of this family.
so why don't you maybe tend to your mangle or your scuttle?
the head of the family ain't here.
tommy, uh.
sometimes helps me with, uh, with business.
aye, well, speak of the devil.
how are you, son?
get out.
come on, son.
i'm a changed man.
this family needed you 10 years ago.
and you walked out on us.
not now.
get out of this house.
- tommy, he's different.
- shut up.
it's all right, son.
arthur shelby... never stays where he's not welcome.
quite something you've become.
bye,son.
he's our dad.
he's a selfish bastard.
you calling someone a selfish bastard?
it's a bit rich, tommy.
i mean, thanks to you, we're already down a bloody sister.
you want to see him, arthur?
you want to see him?
you go with him.
grace.
i'm taking five pounds from petty cash, all right?
we don't have five pounds in petty cash.
then i'll take what we've got.
count it and leave a receipt.
arthur, there are things in these books i don't understand.
likewise.
every week we pay one pound, ten shilling by postal order to a daniel owen
-in london.
- danny whizz-bang.
hangs around in the pubs in camden town wharf for us.
keeps his ears open for business. he's a good man.
i thought danny whizz-bang was dead?
then you thought wrong, didn't you?
but i've seen his grave. he was shot.
that was a show to satisfy the wops.
tommy just shot some sheep's brains at him.
who's buried in his grave?
now look, grace.
you know what's good for you.
you don't ask questions about things that don't concern you.
never, right?
that's for you.
don't tell tommy i took this.
the boy needs a good hiding if you ask me.
yeah, well, i'm this close to giving him one.
john and ada too, sounds like.
nah,john moans on bloody principle.
but if you saw his missus...
ah...
you have a girl yourself, son?
perhaps when it suits, tommy, eh?
yeah, well.
he's been different.
- you know, since the war.
- yeah, well...
a war can change a man.
speaking for myself, anyways.
where did you fight, dad?
ah, all over, son.
- all over.
- yea h, all over.
and the salvation of jesus christ spread his light over me.
and as a pilgrim,
i come to visit a new world.
america.
where i beheld the future.
casinos.
money factories, son.
look, i've been studying the competition.
their schemes, their systems.
- look at that. it's all there.
- show me.
there's a fortune to be made here.
i'm an old man and my heart's a battered vessel.
but within, there still beats a fluttering pulse of a dream.
the shelby...
casino and hotel.
gents and dames will come flocking from all corners.
new york, chicago, boston, to the shelby.
where i can stand proudly with my dear children by my side.
and the women there?
like fresh peaches.
thou could have a dozen.
we'd all of us be kings.
how much? how much to get started?
the oak needs but an acorn.
let's do it.
let's do it. let's bloody do it.
it would make my heart beam, but i don't want to cause any discord between the brothers. so please, why don't you talk to tommy first?
no, now, i'm sick of taking orders from him.
tommy's not the only one in the family with a head for business.
and shelby money is shelby money.
i thank god for my wonderful sons.
this is cause for a celebration.
<i>- yea</i> h . <i>- slainte.</i>
<i>slainte.</i>
on your feet, soldier.
on your feet.
look, i don't wanna fight you, dad.
come on, boy!
i'm old enough to be your father.
on your feet!
get up!
all right!
is that all you got, boy?
get up!
this here... is arthur shelby junior!
my son!
i love him and i'm proud of him!
and he can fight any one of youse in here!
you did good, son.
you did good.
i love you, dad.
i love you!
mr shelby?
who's asking?
my name's burn.
i had word from your man in camden town you wanted a parley.
then parley it is.
few months ago, a man named ryan came to this place with a view to buying some goods from you.
mr ryan met with an accident, he was shot.
i heard.
he was a man with a quick mouth. i know that.
wondered if he made any enemies in here?
none that i know of.
not the kind of place to make enemies.
- all are welcome here, mr burn.
- including irish?
oh, especially irish.
ryan told you he was a member of the irish republican army.
was he still welcome?
like i say. any man who buys beer is welcome.
perhaps you didn't believe him?
in pubs, sometimes people say things.
sometimes it's the whisky talking.
it's hard to tell which is which.
as a teetotal man, i find that amusing.
except when it ends in tragedy.
would you like some water and cordial, mr burn?
you see, mr shelby,
ryan, for all his quick mouth, was indeed connected.
very well connected to our brotherhood.
by membership in blood.
he was my cousin.
i'm from south armagh.
i'm a man of influence there.
cordial and water will be grand, mr shelby.
grace, bring some water and cordial. come this way.
yes, mr shelby.
my cousin came to buy guns.
and i told him i have none.
your man danny owen talks a lot when he's drunk.
he says the peaky blinders do have the guns, brought from the factory down the road.
he boasted about a stack of lewis machine guns, and enough belts of ammunition to hold up god's trousers.
yup, that sounds like our danny.
he has an imagination.
like i say, sometimes it's the whisky does the talk.
he says only your brothers know where the guns are kept.
well, danny also says he sees german infantrymen on the back of mill carts.
and he shoots them with his broomstick.
we have men in the bsa factory.
they said you has 'em.
and we have men that work in the police station.
every finger, mr shelby...
every finger in this city points in one direction.
please don't mistake me for a fool.
let me get to the point.
i don't care what kind of half-arsed tinker operation you have going here.
but i can assure you,
i represent a very different category of organisation.
my cousin was shot.
i am judge, jury, and executioner.
i find you guilty and i pass sentence.
you deliver the guns to me, or i deliver death and hell's fury to you, and your little tribe of heathens.
am i making myself clear?
let me confess something to you, and only to you.
i have the guns, but they have become a burden to me.
perhaps it is time to unload that burden.
for the right price.
malachy burn.
brigade commander of the south armagh ira.
you hooked yourself a big fish there.
with these guns as bait, who knows what we'll catch?
we?
are you suggesting that you and i could work together as a team?
perhaps we have more in common than you think, inspector.
- can you deliver him?
- with your help.
and i want word put out in ireland that i was not involved.
so i'd be solving a problem for you.
and i'd be winning you that medal.
if i get a medal, i will have your initials engraved on my backside.
oh. my initials on your backside. that's quite an image.
inspector, since we're getting on so well... can you answer me a question?
who gave you freddie thorne?
well, as everyone in the city knows... it was you, mr shelby.
- hello, son.
- it's all there.
it is indeed. we're gonna build something with this, son.
- something magnificent.
- when do we start, dad?
- hungry for work, are you?
- yeah!
ship sails friday. meet me at the boxing ring.
- good. friday.
- friday.
no, leave that open.
- no.
- are you expecting trouble?
- yeah.
- at this hour?
- midnight is as good an hour as any.
- what the hell is going on?
when the st andrews' bell strikes midnight, two ira men are going to come through that door.
when they have what they want, they plan to kill me.
it's your job to stop that happening.
could have given me some more warning.
i just got the message myself. they want to meet here, alone.
- and barmaids don't count?
- no, barmaids don't count, no.
you're going to be in that back room. i'm going to be sitting there.
when i make a toast, you're going to come out with that thing raised.
you don't shoot, you just point. i'll do the rest.
- will you kill them?
- no. the police want them alive.
- the police know about this?
- look, just hold it up.
just point, right?
right, go, go! go on, go!
we'll hold back here.
if damage is done to either side, it's no concern of ours.
- lost your thirst, eh? -just show us where.
give me the cash.
you're gonna need a shovel.
you thick fucking tinker. do you think we'd let you live?
make your peace, mr shelby.
i'll make my peace my own way.
to barmaids who don't count.
why did you shoot? why did you shoot, grace?
i didn't know i had it in me like that. i didn't...
now you've seen me.
and you've seen me.
i'm sorry.
you were supposed to come on the sixth chime.
you were supposed to come on the fucking sixth chime!
they refused to surrender.
they fought well, they were brave men.
well, he looks like he was killed by a wild fucking animal.
still. this never happened. they were never here. who cares?
get the bodies out of here.
ah, right. are they making the lady uncomfortable?
i'll leave you two love birds to it, then, eh?
thank you.
i'm sorry.
first of all, let me say...
i had no idea he would involve you in this ugly business.
if i had, i never would have let it happen.
he trusts me. i told you that. you didn't believe me.
fine.
sergeant moss made a report, which, of course, i burnt.
he said that when he entered the room, you were embracing.
is that your primary concern, now? an embrace?
- no, my concern is for your welfare.
- it was me who killed them.
- i had no control.
- you've been living with beasts.
it was the beast that tried to stop me.
i believe, last night, something inside me changed.
i no longer feel the need to avenge my father.
the hatred that i brought here with me is gone.
and therefore my reasons for joining the service.
you want to resign?
i think our mission has come to a natural end.
i think i know where the guns are hidden.
you do? so tell me where!
if i'm right and the guns are found, you have no more business with thomas shelby. is that not so?
our military mission will be over, and we can leave the city as we found it.
are you trying to do a deal with me? because if you are, you must be explicit.
i want your word that tommy shelby will not be harmed if the guns are recovered.
your word as a gentleman. will you give it?
now, why would you want to save him?
- residue of sympathy.
- sympathy? you mean, sentiment?
yes. in his way, he has been kind to me.
- sentiment.
- yes.
you're too good-hearted for this work.
perhaps.
so, for my sake, will you spare him?
you have my word.
a week after the robbery, there was a burial at st andrews' churchyard.
i have found out that the man supposed to be buried is alive.
arthur is quite concerned.
i learned that the funeral was attended only by the brothers, and the grave that they dug was far deeper than your average, and lined with lead to keep out the damp.
the guns are buried in that grave.
then tonight we will dig up that grave.
<i>grace'. # when my family thinks</i>
<i># that i'm safely in my bed</i>
<i># oh, from morn until night</i>
<i># i am stretched out at your head</i>
<i># calling out unto the earth</i>
<i># with tears hot and wild</i>
<i># for the loss of a boy</i>
<i># that i loved as a child</i>
<i># so i am stretched on your grave</i>
<i># and i'll lie here forever</i>
<i># if your hands were in mine</i>
<i># i'd be sure they would not sever</i>
<i># my apple tree, my brightness</i>
<i># it's time we were together</i>
well done, boys!
<i># for i smell of the earth</i>
<i># and i'm worn by the weather #</i>
all but one gun accounted for.
then, sir, i resign my commission.
good... good.
so, i am no longer your superior officer, and you're no longer my subordinate.
and therefore...
regulations permit me to offer you this.
i'm a simple man, but a good man.
and my admiration for you has turned to love.
i don't ask for love in return, just recognition that we are like minds, with shared values.
grace...
will you marry me?
mr campbell...
you deserve better.
is it him between us?
is it the beast that dug that grave?
is it him?
my resignation will be with you in the morning.
dad?
hello, son.
may i ask who gave you my whereabouts?
marsden. said you left him last night with a bill for your whores.
well... at least we got to say goodbye, son.
and bid a fond adieu to your dear brothers, would you?
- how could you do this to us?
- do what, son?
all that stuff you said about...
shelby casino...
- and atlantic city.
- hmm, well, if the truth be told,
i'm not so acquainted with that promised land as i had thee believe.
you're a fucking liar.
and a thief.
now you give me back my fucking money!
do not despise the thief who steals to satisfy his starvation.
that's in the holy bible, son.
and i have starved for so very long.
fair thee well, son.
i waited for ya.
i waited.
listen to me, boy.
you're not in the prize ring now.
never put your hands on me again or i'll cut your fucking throat and spread you on these tracks.
where's your father?
i'm assuming he's frittering away the 500 you took from us and put into his thieving, whore-groping hands.
what were you thinking?
how dare you do something like that without talking to thomas or me?
does tommy know?
no.
but you're going to tell him.
you may take satisfaction in a great victory.
a terrible consequence has been avoided.
<i>those guns that we dug up will never be used to murder the innocent,</i>
<i>or usurp the status qua.</i>
<i>but even though we have solved a crime,</i>
<i>we have, as yet, failed to punish the criminal.</i>
this man who dug this grave has also dug his own.
he has proved a deadly menace to the king's peace.
<i>and tonight we will strike him down.</i>
<i>we will drive our swords through his black heart.</i>
<i>we will pursue him into the rat holes that he infests.</i>
and finally, we will rid this city of his kind.
<i>justice will be done.</i>
<i>and will be seen to be done.</i>
amen.
there's going to be trouble now, finn.
you look after yourself, do you hear me?
i'm gonna be gone away for a while.
right. go on.
right!
who wants to fucking fight?
fighting's over.
we're closing up and moving on.
i said, "who wants to fucking fight?"
my name is arthur fucking shelby.
who dares fight me?
go home, lad. before you catch yourself a spanking.
my brother in digbeth just said the police are coming down from deritend, in numbers.
asking for tommy shelby, by name.
shit.
- i'm gonna have to lie low for a while.
- why?
i lost my bargaining power.
this copper, it's just me and him now.
when i get back,
i wanna tell you some things.
harry said the police are already in digbeth.
- yeah.
- you took a chance coming here.
why?
the police are in the lane, tommy.
come with me.
i'm looking for thomas shelby.
never heard of him.
you'll never find him.
go home.
perhaps i should ask that question again.
on your knees.
aye.
understand this, barman,
i don't care if you live or die.
i don't know!
he left.
with the barmaid.
he left with grace.
i think they were going to her place.
call it off.
i don't understand, sir, we should find the barmaid and...
call it off!
all of it.
get in!
it's not much of a place.
it's all right.
- want tea?
- tea, no.
i have rum.
actually, tea it is.
- trying to impress me?
- yes.
and do you have biscuits?
no, they attract mice.
people look different at home.
in what way?
off guard.
should i be on my guard?
no.
i'm a man who drinks tea.
when the trouble dies down, i'll go.
when will it die down, do you think?
late, i'd say.
so not until the morning then.
yes, i'd say i'll be here till morning.
you have a gramophone.
it's broken.
we could still dance.
yes, why not?
i know you like to be asked properly.
grace, can i have this dance?
<i>grace'. are you okay?</i>
<i>i don't hear the shovels against the wall.</i>
what shovels?
will you help me?
help you with what?
with everything.
the whole fucking thing.
fucking life.
business.
i found you.
and you found me.
we'll help each other.
our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...
hello?
send a telegram to mr churchill.
i have news, very good news.
<i>tell him the business i came to attend to is now complete.</i>
<i>i'll be leaving the city.</i>
<i>there's just one matter i need to tidy up first.</i>
so polly told ya.
yup.
you should've used a gun.
are you laughing at me, tommy?
yeah.
just when things are starting to go right, arthur, you try and do this.
don't you like fancy parties?
or, um...
champagne? or fast cars?
and how about this?
your name on a business card.
"shelby brothers, limited.
"arthur shelby.
"associate bookmaker."
i just had them picked up from the printer's this morning.
you are one of three shareholders.
me, you, john.
and according to the law, we are equal partners.
and it is written in the paperwork in black and white.
a third, a third, a third.
but the thing is, uh...
well, me and john, we quite fancy splitting your share, so... just next time, use a gun, man.
our men at the station tell me that copper is leaving town.
we're in the clear.
we are on our way up in the world, brother.
believe me.
<i># take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the track #</i>
mr churchill.
if there are bodies to be buried...
dig holes.
and dig them deep.
don't do this in here.
you're taking me away from my baby!
- freddie!
- ada!
it wasn't me who shot freddie thorne.
he trusts me, i told you that.
i think i know where the guns are hidden.
i want your word that thomas shelby will not be harmed if the guns are recovered.
it would be an honour to work with you, mr kimber.
nobody works "with" me. people work "for" me.
black star. what does that mean?
black star day is the day we take out billy kimber and his men.
grace...
will you marry me?
you deserve better.
is it him?
- where is he?
- he left.
with the barmaid.
service?
we don't open two more hours.
you come back later.
police.
inspector campbell, sir.
any trouble, sir?
look...
i know.
i know.
that is,
i'm given to understand by several of my officers...
several of my officers that people come here...
that men come here for... a certain purpose.
arthur. arthur, wake up!
get home, get bathed, check your kids, check your weapons.
why?
what's going on?
we're doing it today.
<i># where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires</i>
<i># hey man, you know you're never coming back #</i>
fetch the wagons, charlie.
it's today.
<i># on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man</i>
<i># in a dusty black coat with a red right hand #</i>
i'll be there in a minute, mate! john, i've told you to keep the doors locked.
it could have been anyone.
get dressed.
we're doing it today.
as a matter of fact, he's doing me today.
make sure he's done you by 9:00.
you should learn to knock!
it's not a day for knocking.
dear lord, make this day pass well.
let none get hurt, and make them that do not shelbys.
watch john,
'cause he has so many depending on him.
<i>watch arthur,</i> because he's as likely to hurt himself as anyone else.
watch thomas.
i know how he is.
but he does what he does for us.
i think.
amen.
i used to do that every morning during the war.
think'd i'd done it for the last time.
today will be the last time, poll.
after today, there'll be no need for prayers.
we'll be set.
family meeting, half-ten.
i'm sorry i kept you.
it is so early.
that's all right.
i, i didn't sleep last night.
mr zhang said that you are special, special customer.
do you want to sit?
do you want to take off your boots?
yes.
and, this.
so tight.
we can also clean and press your shirt while we do this.
ah, that's a very efficient service.
you've never been to a place like this before?
it's okay.
sometimes old men who lost their wives, they come here all the time.
old men?
i am so old?
no, i mean...
i am young. anyway---
i will make you young as well.
whore.
<i>dear grace,</i>
<i>i write this letter to you with a heavy heart.</i>
<i>i know exactly what you did.</i>
<i>and with whom.</i>
<i>i will not mention any of it in my report.</i>
<i>however, you should be aware</i>
<i>that i know you gave yourself to the man who is our sworn enemy.</i>
<i>that is not only treason,</i>
<i>it is disgusting beyond all measure.</i>
<i>your father would be ashamed of you.</i>
<i>and as for myself, i am beyond desolation.</i>
<i>you have betrayed every principle and standard of honour</i>
<i>that was your birth right.</i>
<i>and, for what?</i>
love.
oh, my god, i'm sorry, did i do that?
it's okay.
you are special, special customer.
would you sit with me for a moment?
please?
for the suits.
you want to hear something funny?
i am unarmed.
it's curious, inspector.
i thought you came here to clean up the city.
not to sleep with its whores.
you're no different from any other copper that came before you.
i'm no different from those who would follow, should i choose to leave.
oh, you've no reason to stay.
you have what you came for.
yes, i have what i came for.
i have a meeting with mr winston churchill at midday.
and, no doubt, he intends to congratulate me on finding those stolen guns.
and you still don't know how we found them, do ya?
good.
oh, you got lucky.
did i?
yeah.
one thing i have learned is that you and i are opposites.
but also just the same.
like an image in a mirror.
we hate people.
and they in turn hate us.
and fear us.
before the day is over, your heart will be broken.
just the same as mine.
men like us, mr shelby, will always be alone.
and the love we get, we will have to pay for.
you forget, inspector,
i have my family.
enjoy your day.
oh, little one.
you're much better with him than i am.
he settles quicker with me because he can't smell the milk.
you're tired.
let's put him down.
mine were terrors for the tit.
both of them.
well, you never knew my children, did you?
i was a child myself then.
you never talk about them.
i've no reason to.
heart breaks even when i think about them.
but, today,
i do have reason to.
sit down, ada.
they were three and five years old.
sally was three, michael was five, well, two weeks away from being six.
it was sunday morning,
i was at church...
"you're not forgiven."
this...
pinched-faced bitch said to me, "you're not forgiven."
you see, some sheets i'd washed and hung on the line had the name of a hotel in them.
they'd been stolen in a robbery, and they said some porter at the hotel had been coshed.
and a woman from around here told the police about the sheets.
jealous, you see, about the new sheets.
and when the police came, they found a spirits still.
making a few drops of gin.
and for that...
they took my children from me.
and they never told me where they took them.
and they did it 'cause they could, and 'cause i was weak.
they will never take your baby away from you.
do you know why?
'cause tommy won't let them.
'cause tommy won't let them walk all over us.
now, it is tommy that has brought strength and power to this family.
'cause he knows...
you have to be as bad as them above in order to survive.
i'm telling you this because i want you to forgive him.
how can i?
when my freddie's rotting in jail because of him.
there's something about today you need to know.
all right, freddie. time to go.
i want to get a message to campbell.
i can't let them move me to brixton.
if i go to brixton, they'll kill me.
freddie...
you're not going to get as far as brixton prison.
you're free.
i told the prime minister personally that the guns have been retrieved, and he actually heard me and listened, and i'm pretty sure he gave me a half smile.
he never usually smiles unless a political opponent dies.
i've plan to put your name forward in the new year's honours list.
- that would be too much, sir.
- nonsense.
you deserve it.
as i recall, you wrote to me several times about an undercover operative, a woman.
was she involved in the discovery?
does she deserve some kind of commendation?
yes.
she was instrumental.
a truly loyal servant to the crown.
and that is what the record should state.
and what of the men who actually stole the guns? the peaky...
blinders, sir.
if we were to make arrests, the whole thing would end up in open court, and i know we wish to keep this matter confidential.
so they'll go free?
not quite, sir.
see, i have plans for the peaky blinders.
all right?
leave that, boys, we'll get back to it later.
right.
we've brought you all here today
'cause this is the day we replace billy kimber.
this is the day we become respectable.
the day we join the official national association of racecourse bookmakers.
but, first, we do the dirty work.
now, you've all known this day's been coming,
i just haven't told anyone the date.
we're going to the worcester races.
track opens at 1:00, we get there at 2:00.
now, kimber thinks we're going there to help him fight the lee brothers.
thanks to the efforts of our john and his lovely new wife, esme, the lees are now our kin.
i interrupted those efforts this morning and, uh,
i can assure you all, john is making great sacrifices in the cause of peace.
yea h, a ll rig ht.
so it'll be us and the lees against kimber's boys.
we take 'em out and leave the bookies.
i'll expect a swift victory which will send a signal all the way to london that we believe in letting legitimate businesses run peacefully.
john: and, uh, what about kimber himself?
i'll deal with kimber.
any other questions?
yes.
does anyone object if i bring a newcomer to the meeting?
come on.
i'd like to introduce the newest member of the shelby clan.
welcome home, ada.
we named him karl.
after karl marx.
karl bloody marx.
let me get a look at him.
oh, here we go.
hey, look!
he looks just like me, look!
- unless his arse looks like you.
- he's all right.
he's a shelby.
well, ada...
am i forgiven?
if what aunt polly says is true, you are.
it's true.
thank you, tommy.
so who the hell are you?
someone who wants to keep his eyes.
they came to my house, told me to volunteer for this.
who did?
the peaky blinders.
tommy, tommy, tommy.
get out of the way!
what the bloody hell is that?
looks like your friends are here.
stay down on the ground! or the next one's for you.
<i>uh'.!</i>
make it look good.
i am sorry about this, comrade.
holy shit!
- danny, you're dead!
- no. i've been living in london.
same thing.
in you get.
all right, lads, listen up.
you have a pint and a chaser, no more, on the house.
right. let's get pouring.
do you have the enclosure tickets?
and the registered bookkeepers on the track?
in me coat.
you did a good job, grace.
- much.
- much.
next family meeting,
i'll make sure you're there.
if i were family.
but i'm not.
that could change.
- tommy...
- we'll talk about it more when i get back, all right?
when will you be back?
oh, is this how it's gonna be, eh?
you waiting at home for me, saying, "what time do you call this?"
the barrel needs changing.
go on, tom. go out the back, give her a good seeing to before we go.
all right?
hey, grace, i was joking.
tommy, we need more mild.
just help yourselves!
tommy, the truth is...
when you come back from the races, i won't be here.
what are you talking about?
all right, look.
grace, i know you weren't born to be with a man like me.
but i'm turning things around.
when i get back here tonight, i will have one of the biggest legal race track syndicates in the country.
i'm gonna close down some of that other stuff.
maybe open a club.
hey, back in london.
and another thing, you have a contract of employment.
with a real limited company.
you remember?
i remember everything, tommy.
i am going to a make a success of this.
i am going to a make a success of it.
- i am.
- i know.
i know.
i'm not talking about marriage.
i'm so...
we know each other.
we can talk.
we're the same.
tommy, i've done something terrible to you.
right. tell him what you just told me.
just heard there's two vans driving up the stratford road.
an old corporal of mine said he recognised some of the men.
he said it's the kimber boys.
and they're heading this way.
ada! wake up!
you and the baby, get into the bullring where there's lots of people.
- what's going on?
- we've been fucking betrayed.
someone let slip. kimber's men are on their way here.
- yeah, but you can handle them, tommy.
- it's just us.
all the lees are on their way to worcester, we're outnumbered.
fuck!
who else knew today was the day you were moving on kimber?
you said you kept it a secret. who else did you tell?
there's only one thing can blind a man as smart as you, tommy.
love.
it's that barmaid.
i'll deal with grace.
if you set eyes on her again, you might kill her.
going for good?
i heard there was trouble.
instinct's a funny thing.
see, normally i can tell about a person, but with you...
look, the fighting's about to begin.
- we should get out of here.
- we know who you are.
tommy knows as well.
turned out that copper as good as told him this morning.
but i wanted to hear it from your own lips.
i am an agent of the crown.
i have the power to arrest and the right to use force.
so please, step out of my way.
like i say, instinct's a funny thing. you fell for tommy for real, didn't you?
this gun is loaded.
i'm not afraid of you.
i feel sorry for you.
slip of a thing.
thought you'd come in here and stitch us all up.
i mean, we've had some copper's narks in here, but you...
you're the queen of them all.
so who are you?
rich girl, i'd guess.
unionist. ulster volunteer.
you thought, "fenians, communists, low people...
"they're all the same. scum."
then you met tommy.
i'll fight you with my fists and show you how a rich girl fights.
i'm from a tough family, too.
nah.
we women have more sense.
why don't you pour us both a drink?
so am i right?
did you fall for tommy?
yes, i did.
then i pity you.
you think he'll try to kill me?
that's too soft.
- soft? -soft.
like you.
you saved his life the night the coppers came.
that's why we're drinking, not fighting.
we owe you.
what was he like?
before france?
he laughed. a lot.
he wanted to work with horses.
he won medals?
threw them in the cut.
not a single man came back the same.
you know, after all this is over, he might forgive you.
he might take you in.
can never tell with men.
they go for whoever their dicks point at and there's no changing their minds.
but i should tell you something.
i will never forgive you.
or accept you.
or take you in.
and it's me who runs the business of the heart in this family.
and as far as i'm concerned, you're a snitch from the parish.
and if you're not gone from this city by tomorrow,
i'll kill you myself.
now go.
maybe what really upsets you is the thought that one day you might lose him.
tommy! we've had word from nipper at hay mills, and he says the police are letting them through.
and how come all our police have disappeared?
'cause it was the police who told kimber about the plan.
and who told the police?
you know what,john? for all i think i'm the smart one,
i'm guessing it was me.
all right, men.
you were mostly in the war, so you know that battle plans always change and get fucked up, well here it is.
things have changed.
we fight them here. today. alone.
now, they're gonna come for the pub, they're gonna try and break us up for good.
and we'll have no help from the law today.
that pub there is called the garrison!
well, now it really is one.
and it belongs to us! right?
right!
how many are there?
jeremiah said two reilly vans.
so i reckon we're outnumbered three to one.
<i>arthur". ah, fuck.</i>
but it's us, boys, it's us!
the small heath rifles.
never lost a fight yet, did we?
- no!
- all right!
jeremiah, i know you vowed to god to never pick up a weapon again.
but can you ask him from me if you can help us today.
god says he done a deal with small heath, sir.
good man!
arthur, scudboat, you take the flanks.
- just like at st marie.
- sure.
curly.
if any shelby man dies here today, you bury us side by side.
all right. we've about ten minutes.
make your peace with whoever.
we've heard a report of a large group of men in vehicles heading towards the city.
most of them are known to the police, sir.
uh. we think a gang fight's about to break out.
i want all officers and constables stood down in the following areas.
bordesley,
small heath, shard end, greet,
-and hay mills.
- stood down, sir?
immediately. and the vehicles approaching the city
-should not be impeded.
- what the hell is going on?
let dog eat dog.
let the beasts devour each other.
and then we shall pick the bones.
she's gone, then?
you're not accustomed to not getting what you want, are you, tommy?
you wanted my pub, and you took it.
you got a fair price.
what i got was an ultimatum.
like you give to everybody.
do it, or else.
and yet, it's funny, everybody around here, they want you to win this battle.
i think what it is, you're bad men, but you're our bad men.
will you go looking for her?
she's in the past.
the past is not my concern.
the future is no longer my concern either.
what is your concern, tommy?
one minute.
<i>tommy". the soldier's minute.</i>
in a battle, that's all you get.
one minute of everything at once.
anything before is nothing.
everything after, nothing.
nothing in comparison to that one minute.
didn't you get enough minutes over there?
seems not, doesn't it?
tommy, they're here!
get your weapons out, boys, and load 'em up.
take your time.
hold 'em up in the air so's they can see what we've got.
all guns and no balls, right, billy boy?
so what do we do now? just give the order.
the men that have arrived in garrison lane, they're armed with rifles.
did you hear me?
their methods of self-destruction are not my concern.
well, we've outside reports of machine gun fire in saltley.
it's the ravings of an old soldier with shell shock.
we only found 24 of those 25 lewis guns. if they were to get use of one...
you know, uh... when you came here from belfast, i was overjoyed.
i was sick of this force, and i was sick of all the corruption.
when you made that speech about cleaning this place up,
i gave a little cheer inside.
you said it was the devil's work to look the other way.
i am not looking the other way, sergeant moss.
i am looking directly at the events of the day!
and i like what i see.
it doesn't have to be like this, kimber.
it's too late for all that.
you've bit off more than you can chew, you little toe-rag, and now i'm going to take over this shithole.
well... if we have to use guns...
let's use proper guns!
sergeant thorne reporting for duty, sir.
you were saying something about being out-gunned?
move!
what are you doing?
i believe you boys call this "no man's land".
- ada!
- shut up and listen.
- have you lost your mind?
- i said shut up!
now, most of you were in france. so you all know what happens next.
i've got brothers and a husband here, but you've all got somebody waiting for you.
now, i'm wearing black in preparation.
i want you to look at me.
i want you all to look at me!
we'll be wearing black for you.
think about them.
think about them right now, and fight if you want to, but that baby ain't moving anywhere.
and neither am i.
she's right, you know.
why should all you men die?
it should just be them whose caused it!
tommy, come here!
don't shoot! you're all right, son!
- you're all right.
- ada, move away!
don't shoot!
hold your guns up!
enough!
kimber and me fought this battle one-on-one.
it's over.
go home to your families.
scudboat, curly, pick him up.
i want to ask you one question. then i'll leave.
tommy knows who i am. what did you say to him?
what did you say to him?
i told him...
that his heart would be broken before the day was over.
so it seems... you've broken two hearts, grace.
as well as my own.
that's it, tommy, that's it! fight it, tommy!
- no!
- take it! take it!
- hold him still!
- that's it, lad!
come on! come on!
- there! i still have the knack.
- argh!
have a drink.
all right. deep breath!
that's it. it's done!
now we can bury him properly, in the grave we dug for him.
yeah. it's high on a hill. he'll like that.
- to danny whizz-bang.
- danny.
may we all die twice.
to danny whizz-bang.
danny whizz-bang.
danny whizz-bang.
come on. the day is ours. let's celebrate.
well, who won?
a mr william kimber has been found dead. a gunshot wound.
so, uh, i'm guessing that means the peaky blinders won, sir.
also, the communist agitator, freddie thorne, was taken from his transport by armed men.
since there were no officers on the street at the time, following your orders, he managed to escape easily and he's now at large.
the, er, prison officers said they recognised the men.
they were peaky blinders as well, sir.
i mean, we could go down there and make a few arrests, but no one will have seen anything.
and there were no officers there to witness, so...
the shelbys'll get away with murder.
just like they always have.
some things never change, eh, sir?
- a toast! to shelby, limited!
- to shelby, limited!
he's got sons. should we find work for them?
no. let 'em be.
let them find ordinary work. like ordinary men.
could you put me through to mr churchill, please?
yes, sir. sir...
i have made a decision about my future.
everyone's leaving town.
- tommy, you're hurt.
- i'm fine.
- what exactly can i say?
- i don't know, grace.
- if i tell you who i really am?
- i think i know who you are.
- okay.
- you know who i am?
circumstance is not important.
- circumstance.
- is all it is.
- just uniform.
- yeah.
someday i will throw this gun in the canal.
why not now?
here it comes, tommy.
i love you.
and there it goes, grace.
away it goes.
you can say it as much as you like.
but there's no chance.
i'll be in london one week. this address.
finish your business here and join me.
i have an idea.
- there he is.
- tommy!
drink?
not whisky.
if you check behind the bar...
you will find a bottle of champagne.
one she bought?
today was a good day.
all of kimber's men were busy here.
so the lee boys took all the pitches at the worcester races.
couldn't have gone better if we planned it.
the shelby brothers, limited, are now the third largest legal racetrack operation in the country.
cheers.
only the sabinis and the solomons are bigger than us, boys.
and all my family is here to celebrate.
to shelby brothers, limited!
- shelby!
- cheers!
there'll be others.
to the others.
all of them.
