Mr Shelby, you're not yourself.
I should call a doctor.
It's just myself talking to myself about myself.
Michael, you're going to New York.
Why?
Because the company has business to attend to in America.
You knew I was going to be shot...
...and you chose not to tell me.
I chose my mum.
<i>Thomas Shelby,
Labour Party, 48,564!</i>
I've been to a doctor on your behalf.
It starts when you stop. When you rest.
Mr Shelby, you're meant to be resting.
I have learnt something, Frances.
There's no rest for me in this world.
<i>Perhaps in the next.</i>
Arthur.
"We cannot give you the assurance you are asking for.
"We expect payment in full."
Here's my favourite part.
"We have never even heard of <i>your</i> people,
"so we are not afraid of your threats."
And they've signed it
"the Angels of Retribution".
Hm.
They say they haven't even heard of us.
So tell Aberama and Isiah to introduce themselves.
And, Finn...
...you stay out of it.
Yeah.
Wait.
Wait, wait. Say that again.
No.
No, that cannot be possible!
Peter, my beautiful pilot...
Now will you please fly me and my winnings back to England?
Ten spoonfuls of sugar for me, please.
Where's that full one?
Look, Ruby.
Daddy's back from his call.
Everything's going to be all right now.
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no.
Ah!
Hello?
Arthur! Arthur, where's Tommy?
Just get to him and tell him that we've lost the lot.
Stay there. You stay put.
You'll hear from Tommy.
Arthur, what are you talking about?
How is that possible?
<i>It's possible because, this morning</i> in New York City at 6am, the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed
<i>like a steam train.</i>
We were most definitely on board.
Fuck it.
- Oi! Come on, get changed!
- Jesus Christ!
Bring the car round!
We've got to get out of here.
Hurry up. Come on!
I'm going!
Change of plan.
We're not going to London any more.
- We're going straight to Birmingham.
- There are other passengers.
Not any more.
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.
- No. No.
- I love you, you love me.
- That's the truth.
- Gina, wait, come on.
I want to meet your family.
No, you don't.
Argh!
<i>Now</i> you've heard of us.
Come on.
Couch. Couch!
Put something down for the blood.
My sister'll fucking kill me.
Be fucking careful.
She spends thousands of pounds on this shit.
Argh!
- Get me some booze.
- Ah!
Just fucking get the thing out of me and sew me up.
Just do it.
Peaky boy, give me your blade.
That's enough.
Don't want you throwing up on your sister's furniture.
- You know what you're doing?
- I've done this a thousand times.
I once took a bullet from between two ribs, one inch from the heart.
Mind you, it was a horse.
And the horse did die.
Hold him. Hold him.
There you go.
Just a little one.
- What the fuck is going on?
- Oh, fuck.
Hello, Ada.
Get out, both of you.
Push this on the wound.
- Keep up the pressure.
- Get out.
I'm so sorry, Ada.
They broke a statue of some thin woman.
Fucking statues.
What has Tommy told you?
- Shelbys stay out of the sporting stuff.
- What?
- To maintain his fucking reputation?
- Oi!
You listen to me.
We've got a chance.
Tommy has given us that chance.
He's got power, we've got money and our past is left behind us.
And you've got a precious young life,
Finn, you fucking idiot.
Three inches to the left and that would have been gone.
You've got nothing to prove, Finn.
You have got nothing to prove.
Daddy! Daddy!
Come here, you. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Ooh!
Now, what have you been up to, eh?
Get it done, Johnny.
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.
Where's Charles?
He's in the wagon. He won't come out.
He heard Johnny talking Rokker.
He understands more Gypsy than we think.
He heard him say you shot the horse.
I told him it was mercy. I said it's what you do when a horse gets sick.
He doesn't understand.
Dad, why did you shoot him?
Charlie, get out here now.
Let's get it done.
Charles? Come here.
Sit down.
Now, listen to me.
Your horse was sick. He was in pain.
The vet couldn't do anything, even Curly couldn't do anything.
I put him to sleep.
- It's what you do.
- No!
It's what <i>you</i> do.
Shoot horses, shoot people.
Everybody says.
Dangerous, my beautiful horse.
Too wild to race.
Wouldn't take the reins or the whip.
Should have been a war horse.
Got tired of the pasture.
Couldn't stick the peace and quiet, gave up on life...
...and is now free.
In the bleak...
You're crying.
Tom...
...I'm sorry.
I didn't know your boy spoke Rokker.
Fill it in, Johnny.
It's fine.
I've called the house, the office.
But if I tell you...
...you won't believe it...
...so I'll show you.
Huh?
I told Michael on Friday this was going to happen.
Yeah.
Fucking Michael... said he was advised by the broker that prices would rebound.
Everybody was told the same thing.
He held on.
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.
Michael.
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.
Michael held on...
...and carried on dancing and playing...
...and fucking in the snow.
Charlie!
Charlie, come out here now!
Kid never fucking listens.
Never listens, Lizzie.
What do I have to do to make people fucking listen to me?!
Holy fuck.
What do we do now, Tommy, eh?
What do we do?
Lizzie, you go with Arthur to Birmingham, you stay in the Midland Hotel.
Arthur, call a full meeting of the board of directors tomorrow at noon.
A full fucking meeting.
What about today, eh?
What's wrong with today, Tom?
- I need to do some thinking.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, you do that best on your own,
- don't you, eh?
- I won't be on my own. Never on my own.
Lizzie, you have the driver come back tomorrow.
And, Arthur, tell my boy...
...that sometimes death is a kindness.
Come on.
<i>What now?</i>
What am I, a genie?
You summon me up with your little bottle of dope.
I take it for the pain, to keep warm.
Is that what it's for?
The warmth?
The warmth.
All this time.
I know.
Our love still remains.
But you have to listen to the voices that you hear.
Do what they tell you to do.
Too much to do, Grace.
The kids.
I need to say goodbye.
I need to sleep.
Just think, Tom.
Linda!
Oh, there you are, eh?
You're the chairman, Arthur, so start acting like one.
Chairman, am I, hm?
No.
I'm the fucking doorman, Linda, hm?
And you ain't coming in here tonight, love, dressed like that.
Tommy made me chairman so that...
...he could stay clean.
It's called an arrangement.
It's an opportunity.
I know who I am, Linda.
I know who I am and I'm all right with it.
Finally.
I can live with it.
I need you to be all right with it.
I need you to be all right with it, eh?
What is it, eh?
And what do you want, hm?
What, do you want the chairman?
Do you? Hmm?
With his fancy briefcase and his gold fountain pen, eh?
What do you want?
Chairman...
...or doorman? Hm?
You think we can fuck and it'll be OK and I'll be quiet. Well, I won't.
Every week, your brother's down in London, making out he's fucking Robin Hood, champion of the people, while you're up here running the racket for him.
And according to your "arrangement", if anything should happen, it'd be you who takes the blame, does the time or swings for it.
- And what do you want?
- I want you...
...to take the opportunity that God and the New York Stock Exchange has presented to you.
Mr Shelby, the meeting will be starting soon.
Yeah. All right.
Be right there.
Thank you, Edna.
And shut the door.
OK, now...
Mmm, they're nice.
...let's begin.
Yesterday, as you all know, there was a fucking terrible...
There was a terrible disaster. Hm?
It wasn't just for us.
It was for the whole world.
Happened in New York.
That's where it happened.
And it slowly spread to London.
And then to, er, fucking Hong Kong. Hm?
Whole thing... whole thing went up.
Well, actually the whole thing went fucking down but...
...we wasn't the only ones hurt by this.
Whole world is hurt.
A lot of people.
In the papers.
It's all over the news.
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Arthur?
Shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?
Polly, Arthur's now the chairman of the board.
Er, Mr Chairman, perhaps while we wait for Thomas,
I might lighten the gloom and express, as a relatively new member of this company, what a pleasure it is to be in a boardroom that has so many females in it, and all females who are both sharp-witted and decorative.
Yeah, well, we're a very modern company, Mr Greene.
Indeed.
Although there are still some among us who cling to their old-fashioned values.
How far have we got?
We've established that ladies are decorative.
We've only just sat down, Tom.
Actually, um, Arthur has some documents that he'd like to hand out.
Yeah?
What documents?
I was just explaining to everyone, Tom, that, um, well, we're fucked.
- Ain't that right? Hm?
- Yes and no.
It is true that a large proportion of the company's funds were invested in American stocks and shares.
Invested or hidden?
All investments are approved by the board, Linda.
Only the ones that went through the books, Thomas.
Linda, after this meeting there will be another meeting, for just family.
Did we vote on this?
Arthur?
"Arthur, can't you control your wife?"
We are a very modern company, Mr Greene.
To be precise, everything we channelled through the New York Stock Exchange is now offering a return of ten cents to the dollar.
And the Nolan Bank of America, where we invested our fluidity, is offering five cents to the dollar on all deposits.
Yeah.
- There is hope.
- Why?
What have you got in there, a magic wand?
As nonexecutive director of the company,
I need the permission from the chairman to present my strategy to the board.
Permission granted, Tom.
The Peaky Blinders are coming.
The Peaky Blinders are coming.
Micky, the Peaky Blinders are coming.
Ladies and gents, Peaky Blinders are on their way. Please vacate. Thank you.
- Good to see you.
- All right, Mr Shelby.
- Mr Shelby...
- Yeah?
...thank you for what you did.
What did I do?
He was going to evict us, that bastard Fellows.
Now he's cut our rent in half.
Good. Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.
All right?
How far can we go, Mr Shelby, with this beautiful dream?
- All the way, brother. All the way.
- Revolution, man.
This crash, Mr Shelby. They're saying they're gonna cut my hours.
- Yeah. Where do you work?
- Greenhams Engineering.
Greenham brothers. I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.
God bless you. God bless you both.
- Enjoy your drink.
- Gentlemen and ladies.
If you'll all move into the saloon bar, where you will all be served a free pint of stingo.
Any man who served in France gets a brandy chaser.
And in spite of what you're reading in the newspapers,
I want to hear singing and laughing.
Fuck the stock market.
Fuck the stock market!
They backed the wrong horses, so fucking what, eh?
Thank you, Mr Shelby. At last, a politician who gets things done.
You're welcome, brother, you're welcome.
- Get down off the furniture.
- Sorry, Ada.
I was getting excited, wasn't I?
Right.
Can I begin this family meeting with a proposal?
From now on, we find somewhere else to meet.
Your husband believes that being seen mixing with the common people is good politics.
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign for socialism, perhaps next time, Polly, you won't wear earrings worth more than the pub.
Right. Family meeting. First item.
This.
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday by Aberama Gold using your gin and a razor blade.
Finn?
He says they were sent to Limehouse.
Chinatown.
Sent by fucking who?
Sent by me.
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.
I listen to you when you tell me no more sport for anyone named Shelby.
I listen to you when you make me promises.
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?
In cash.
He said they were sent to Chinatown to kill somebody.
That kid needs educating, Tommy, really does.
Jesus Christ, Tommy!
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.
But you told Polly.
Tommy told me there was a pimp in East London who sold kids.
Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hm?
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member of the House of Lords, a very wealthy man.
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch, covered in flies.
World's a better place.
Holy fuck! So now your business is improving the world?
Sometimes, Ada...
...killing is a kindness.
Hm?
The man we did the job for is a High Court judge.
We received intelligence from a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.
The police felt the same way about this pimp as we did.
He wasn't worth a trial.
The coppers cleared the streets for us.
This was work commissioned by a High Court judge, by Scotland Yard and by the House of Lords.
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.
Lizzie, you need to understand.
That you tell Polly, not me.
You need to understand that the corridors of Westminster are very dimly lit.
And for those who make the rules, there are no rules.
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?
<i>We? We</i> own the ropes, do we?
Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've listened to me, you wouldn't have known.
When we go home, I'll explain.
I can't be bothered with this shit.
So...
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.
The strategy I outlined earlier to rebuild the conventional part of this business will take time.
- In the meantime...
- Just business as fucking usual.
In the meantime, it is fortunate that we have maintained other sources of cash income.
Because until the stock market recovers, cash is king.
And cash we have.
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.
You're gonna hang yourself.
Someone has to pay for them paintings on your wall, Ada.
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.
Polly...
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...
She's pregnant.
Ada's what?
These days, people tell me things without even speaking.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hm?
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada that it's 1929, times have changed, we've a lot to do, and no-one gives a fuck who the father is.
Really?
I already know who the father is.
But we've had enough shocks for one day.
OK.
All right, go on, then.
How long you known about Ada, huh?
I know her doctor.
He calls me.
Yeah, longer than me.
Have a look at this.
What's that funny writing on there?
Chinese.
Ah, right.
What is it? Hmm?
Bad news?
Maybe.
Angels of Retribution?
Yeah.
Burn the letter they sent.
It's already done.
Look at that, Tom. Hm?
Pulled from our brother, eh?
Finally took a first bullet.
No-one fucking listens to me.
Here, give it here.
I'll keep it for him.
I still have my first one.
Arthur, you can tell our comrades they can come back in.
Where are you going, brother?
The huge losses on the British Stock Exchange will bite into our economy for the foreseeable future.
I therefore must ask the trade unions to possess understanding.
The need for their flexibility and cooperation is paramount in the coming months as we attempt to rebuild this great nation.
Mr Thomas Shelby.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
My right honourable friend, the member for Epping, asks that following the crash, trade union members be more flexible when carrying out their duties.
What he's really asking is that the working man carry the can.
The grand casino in Monte Carlo is a small and timid affair when compared to the wild games of chance being played in London and New York by gamblers in silk gloves and beaver hats, who, when they lose their bets, turn around and ask the shoe-shine to pay for it.
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines and can carriers of South Birmingham and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest that those who so recklessly lost their fortunes on the capitalist lottery learn to shine their own shoes...
...carry their own can and pay their own bills.
Mr Shelby?
I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed your speech.
You speak very eloquently.
Thank you.
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.
Yeah, I know who you are.
My constituency borders yours.
And let me just say, you've come to my attention.
Come.
Ah.
I have bad news, Mr...
Shelby.
We agreed 50,000 on completion of business.
My wife and I have had a misfortune on the London Exchange.
There's 20 there.
You'll have to wait for the rest.
Cavalry, eh?
Mm.
Huh!
Yeah.
I spent a long of time waiting for the cavalry, me.
One time, me and my comrades waited three days.
When the cavalry finally came, an officer, on the back of a fine white horse, joked that he'd been delayed playing a game of whist.
So I took out my Webley revolver and I shot him in the head, stole his horse, reported him for cowardice.
All for a game of chance.
After my people completed their task in Chinatown, they collected all the photographs, letters and cheques that will cause you concern.
I now have them in a safe place.
On Monday, you will give me the full Â£50,000 in cash...
...or I will steal your white horse from under you.
How the fuck did a man like you get into a position of trust in a place of power and privilege?
A man like me?
A man like me?
Lord Suckerby.
I've seen the photographs.
Monday.
Shelby!
Sorry I'm late, Ada.
We've been having briefings from the Home Office.
The police are concerned about the effect of the crash in industrial areas.
- Right.
- Everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
We lost money in New York, so I've been up late.
Your brother been busy?
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala, the former Communist MP for Battersea.
He's been approached by an anarchist group in Walsall - he's setting up a meeting - and there's talk of a mass walk-out of bus drivers, Nottingham and Derby, organised by two Communist convenors not formerly known to Special Branch.
He's also had a telephone conversation with Jessie Eden, who is organising a committee to resist wage cuts across the city.
But he'll report more when he sees her.
It's all in there, though.
Names and everything.
I heard he had the Labour benches roaring approval in the House today.
Huh. If only he meant it, he'd be dangerous.
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.
Times are hard.
Hm.
Exactly how much did you lose?
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.
He thinks that we can turn the collapse of the stock exchange to our advantage.
He says, "When others retreat, you advance."
He says, "We can wave cash in the faces of desperate men."
Tell your brother from me, he's doing excellent work.
I'm told two more military contracts for vehicles and parts for the Army in India are on their way to him.
Fuck.
Come.
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.
It's from Winston Churchill.
He says he was in New York and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin and Chaplin mentioned your name.
So he was in New York and he doesn't mention the crash.
No. Even though, in the bar last night,
Mr Churchill's private secretary reckoned he lost Â£75,000 in two hours.
And you?
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.
You lock up.
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you... you have one more appointment.
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.
A journalist from the <i>Times.</i>
He used to be with the <i>Birmingham Mail.</i>
He sent you some questions.
You said you wanted to meet him.
He's outside.
Yes.
Send him in.
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>
Have a seat.
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?
No.
Once, in Small Heath, you were burning photographs of the King.
<i>- London Times</i>. You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.
I sent you a list of questions.
Yeah, I misplaced them.
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.
Yes.
All I remember is that your questions interested me.
Oh!
Good.
Sorry, just...
Ah, here we are.
Yes, um...
Um... So, Mr Shelby, traditionally in this country, print journalists take no interest in the, er, the private lives of politicians.
Private lives?
But in these modern times, especially in America...
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...
Readers are beginning to say...
...want to know more about the men who represent them.
Of course.
In these modern times.
Whereas before it would have been seen as ungentlemanly to, er, to ask a public figure questions about personal matters
- or business affairs.
- Oh, well. No need to worry.
I'm no gentleman.
Hm.
Er, Mr Shelby, as I said in my letter, ten years ago I was a journalist on the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>
And of course, working in that city, it was impossible not to know your name...
...and your reputation.
So, when I saw that you had been elected as a socialist...
You reflected on the fact that working people can indeed change their lives for the better...
...channel their abilities in new directions, discover better methods, aim for happier outcomes, even win awards for industry.
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.
Was your conversion from bookmaker to socialist politician a gradual thing or...
...a road to Damascus experience?
Yeah.
Now I hear that question...
...I remember receiving your letters and I distinctly remember your use of the word "bookmaker".
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.
I gained a licence in 1919 for on-track betting.
But, since 1923,
I've made my fortune in the manufacture, sale and export of motor cars.
And lately gin.
And lately three new homes for orphaned children.
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.
I have another question, Mr Shelby.
In Birmingham, at the time that I was there, there was a Major Campbell.
He was found dead.
A member of your family was charged.
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.
What is your Tory newspaper more afraid of?
Is it evolution or revolution?
And what is it about working-class men like me, standing up in the House of Commons and speaking from the heart, what is it that so troubles you that you would try to undermine me?
I am talking about specific events, sir.
Which I don't recall...
...with which I was never personally linked, and after which all convictions were quashed.
Yeah, now...
I recall receiving your letter...
...and I recall that when I did...
...I asked a colleague of mine to carry out some research.
Just a moment.
Here we are.
Ah, Michael Levitt.
Correct?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Journalist.
Unmarried.
An apartment in Maida Vale.
An apartment opposite the underground station.
"Unmarried" is underlined.
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.
Sometimes alone.
Sometimes not alone.
Sometimes with other men.
Sometimes with other men.
I'm old-fashioned... Michael.
I believe private lives should remain private.
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?
You gonna write this down...
...in your little fucking book?
Well?
Not yet.
I didn't tell him.
Him knowing or not knowing has no relevance to what we're drinking.
It's vintage.
Fuck it.
This...
...is for us.
Let's drink to the baby.
Polly, do you remember when I was last pregnant?
You were going to take me to Cardiff.
I was going to get rid of it.
What about this time?
Imagine.
The father's scared.
He runs away.
You're left.
Oh, sweetheart.
The baby's black, he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.
But you don't care.
Because the world has changed.
And the baby's eyes are golden.
And you're gonna leave her with
Aunt Polly every day to look after.
Aunt Polly, who insisted that you called her Elizabeth.
How do you know it's a her?
Cos I'm Polly Gray.
It's a girl?
Golden.
To be born in the year 1930, where everything will be changed for the better.
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.
What will Tommy say?
Tommy knows.
Hmm!
He's also seen that the world's big and round and he says, "So what?"
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.
We are flying above the rules now.
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?
That's the beauty.
Hello, Cyril.
Least you're still talking to me.
Where is everyone?
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.
You know, Frances, if there were to be a snap election in this house today...
...wouldn't win it...
...not even if I were running against the devil himself.
No.
- I gathered.
- Mm.
Where's Charles?
Charles is in the stable.
Thank you.
Did Arthur explain?
He said it's God's will.
But you're not God!
No, I'm not God.
Not yet.
<i>In New York City, at 6am,</i>
<i>the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed.</i>
<i>I told Michael on Friday this was going to happen.</i>
We were most definitely on board.
But you have to listen to the voices that you hear.
My name is Mosley. Oswald Mosley.
Yeah, I know who you are.
You have come to my attention.
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>
Ten years ago, I was a journalist on the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>
Course, working in that city, it was impossible not to know your name.
And your... reputation.
What is your Tory newspaper more afraid of?
Is it evolution or revolution?
Dad! There's a phone call for you!
Dad! There's a phone call for you!
Charlie!
Charlie! Wait!
Charlie!
Giddy-up, horsey, giddy-up!
- Dad, there's a phone call for you.
- Good boy.
Good boy.
Will you go back to the house?
And, er, whoever's calling, the operator will have their number, and I'll call them back, eh?
Oh, look, Charlie.
You must have violin practice.
It's Mrs Milligan.
Go on.
And, Charlie!
Charlie, you play loudly.
You might hear some bangs.
Go on.
<i>Mr Shelby?</i>
Maggie, yeah, it's me.
<i>- Yes, Mr Shelby.</i>
- I just missed a call.
Where was it from?
<i>Belfast.</i>
Belfast. Where in Belfast?
<i>Um, I'm not sure.</i>
Do you have the number?
Yeah.
Yeah, can you put me through?
<i>Tommy, don't believe...</i>
Mr Shelby.
My name is Captain Swing, calling from the occupied Six Counties.
And there are some people from the other side of our neat little city that want you dead.
<i>You should also know that this boy, this Michael, your kin,</i> was in his cabin aboard the SS Monroe in Belfast dock, making deals with the very men who want you dead.
Tommy, they're lying!
Now, if you want, we can put a bullet in his head here and now...
...or we can send him home, and you can deal with him.
Send him home.
Very well, Mr Shelby.
But be informed that this kin of yours was talking to representatives from the County Tyrone and Glasgow UVF about how they'd divide up the English racetracks
- after they'd blown away your legs.
- Tommy, they're lying!
And may I ask...
...why you are doing me this favour?
Because, Mr Shelby, we've been informed by people at the very highest level that, since your conversion to socialism, you are now on the side of the angels.
And angels can be useful to us.
Come.
Mr Shelby, the violin teacher wants to know what all those bangs were.
Fireworks.
Was trying them out for Saturday.
You promised the doctor not until after dark.
Oh, it's pretty dark, Frances.
Also, will Mrs Shelby and Ruby be home for dinner tonight?
I don't know.
Dad?
I've learned something this morning.
Have you?
So have I.
And what have you learned, my boy?
Let's get this over with.
I've got a train to catch.
Go get your train, Tom.
I can deal with this.
Oi.
Get it!
Go home.
Come here, you.
Put this on.
There you go.
Look at that, it looks great on you.
Wrap up warm.
Ah!
Wake up.
Rise and shine.
What are you doing here?
Wasting our fucking time on you.
Sit down, Finn.
Sit down.
What do I have to do...
...to make you fucking listen to me?
You took a bullet.
You've been running around the streets with a fucking gun in your hand.
Somebody has to.
Finn, we've got people for that kind of work.
Soldiers. Captains and corporals.
Well, then, what am I?
"What am I?" Jesus Christ.
Yeah, what am I, Tom, huh?
I'm the brother you never got round to.
You're a general, Finn.
You understand?
You're a fucking Shelby, so you're a general.
When did you last see a general anywhere near the blood and the puke, eh?
He's fucking right.
That's what you are.
So on your feet, soldier.
Come on, on your feet.
I thought you just said I was a general.
I did just say you were.
So get on your fucking feet!
Arthur...
Finn. Finn.
Look at this.
This is the bullet that Aberama Gold cut from you.
First and last.
First and last.
Don't lose it.
Go and clean up, put some clothes on.
A nice suit.
I've got some trouble that'll keep you out of trouble.
- Oh, and, erm, Tom...
- Yeah?
...while you're here, erm, I've met this girl
- and I'd like to get married.
- Fuck off. Go, get dressed.
Go on, move.
Go!
Finn, this girl you're trying to impress, tell me about her.
She likes the life.
She likes the life, eh?
Well, find one that hates it.
Look at him, that's what he did.
Now he's chairman of the board.
Go on. Hurry up.
Arthur?
Lizzie and Ruby, are they still at yours?
Yes, Tom, they're still there.
She's coming home today, she said, so...
...she'll be home later.
Hm. Has she been talking about me?
I mean, they talk a lot, you know what women are like.
The kitchen and, you know, kids running around.
I... I don't pay 'em no mind, Tom.
- I don't listen to 'em 'alf the time.
- Yeah.
Well, everything she says is true.
Well...
...you like the life, Tommy.
I don't like the fucking life.
I don't like the fucking life,
I don't like that Michael is coming back today.
Train arrives from Liverpool at three.
Polly will be there.
Take a weapon.
Tell Moss to clear the station of coppers.
You hear me?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Tommy.
I heard 'em say one thing, though.
Just talking, you know, they were saying that, er, you... you don't sleep or something.
You can't sleep.
When I do sleep, I dream.
And in my dream, someone wants my crown.
I think it might be Michael.
Call me at three.
Arthur, I'm gonna put that bullet on a necklace and wear it as a reminder.
Arthur?
- I heard you.
- You got trouble for me, then?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Mr Shelby, the... the police are here to see you.
Police aren't allowed in here.
Er, he's not in uniform and said it's very unofficial.
Afternoon. Someone get you some tea?
No, I'm fine, Mr Shelby.
- This won't take long.
- Good.
You've got five minutes.
Mr Shelby, there was a shooting two days ago.
A man died.
It was a murder.
In Maida Vale.
Of all places.
- His name was Levitt.
- Uh-huh.
He was a journalist.
The night before he was shot, he came here to see you.
We found a Commons pass and your name in his diary.
I was wondering what his business here was.
And I'm wondering...
...what your business here is.
According to his diary, you knew him from Birmingham.
What's your name?
Stacker.
Stacker. OK.
Mr Shelby, Mr Levitt was a queer.
Some may think it was one of his queer friends...
Mr Stacker,
I get the feeling that, with a little provocation, you could be very persistent.
Only within my remit.
Well, your Chief Constable Wyatt, he has clear views about persistence, which he has shared with me.
Mr Shelby...
He likes persistence, as do I.
And thoroughness.
But not frivolity.
A man who walks in the park with other men dies in Maida Vale.
And you come to me?
As well as his diary, we have his notebook.
Your time's up, Mr Stacker.
Thank you.
Hello, Mum.
This is Gina.
Gina Gray.
The captain married us on board.
She's my wife, Mum. At least look at her.
Tommy said to ask you to tell me the truth.
We've been travelling for 15 days,
Mrs Gray.
Maybe we could talk about this at another time.
Yes.
Let's go home and we can talk.
You have no home until you tell me the truth.
Here?
Yeah.
Michael!
Hello, love.
Welcome to Birmingham, eh?
Michael?
OK.
Our ship docked at Belfast.
I was then taken off the ship by two men.
At gunpoint.
I'm speaking to my son.
Fuck you.
Fuck you too, Arthur.
This is my fucking wife.
I bring her home... To this?
Come on, Gina.
Well, where are you going now, eh? Hmm?
Introduce me at least.
- Excuse me.
- Look at this.
Look at this.
This is it, Gina.
This is my fucking people.
Do you want to know the truth, Arthur?
Do you want to know the truth, Mum?
I did not betray my fucking family!
Now, Mum...
...I want to go home.
I've booked you a suite at the Midland Hotel.
Was that Tommy's orders, then, was it?
See, the Midland Hotel is Tommy's little kingdom.
Where all the porters keep an eye, where all the telephone exchange girls are reporting on my calls.
Yeah, well, why don't you think of it like, er, quarantine, Michael, eh?
We'll treat you like a fucking dog, hmm?
Smelly one.
Stinking one.
Until we know you're clean, hmm?
Fuck you, Arthur.
Stand aside, Arthur.
No, Poll.
Come on, baby.
Forget about 'em.
Go and phone Tommy, tell him.
Polly says Michael's telling the truth.
It's all right. Forget about 'em.
All right, Poll.
Nice coat.
What are you like? Camel, right?
Oh.
Welcome to the family, Gina Gray.
I applaud the attempt by Mr Rowley in the Education Bill to raise the school leaving age to 15.
I also support...
...as regards means-testing of any kind,
- we are the people...
- Yeah!
- ...we've had enough.
- Yeah!
"We are the people, and we've had enough."
I move in favour of the amendment.
Mr Shelby.
I must say, you sing like a songbird in the House.
And who is this pretty finch?
My sister.
Who's pregnant.
And dangerous.
Oh, we adore dangerous.
Who's <i>we?</i>
It's a collective noun, in this case describing a group of people who are impatient and young and, as I have said, adore dangerous.
Mr Shelby, you had a horse of that name.
Whiskey. Irish.
Give him one from my bottle.
And one for myself.
In fact, bring the bottle.
And the lady?
Isn't thirsty.
How do you know about the horse?
We have a mutual acquaintance.
May Carleton.
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"
And why were you asking after me?
Because, as I have said,
I adore dangerous.
And where did she begin?
You know, I was rather hoping we might have this meeting alone.
My sister is my political adviser.
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."
Because I am dangerous?
No.
What is it you are impatient for,
Mr Mosley?
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.
Bennett!
May Carleton spoke about you the way I imagine one might about a party they barely remember, where you crash the car into the dovecote and live on champagne and cocaine for three whole days.
You know, that kind of party.
Only three days?
Hmm.
My sister advised against meeting you because it appears you are moving away from the party...
...in a different direction.
And which direction is that?
Towards fascism.
"We are the people, and we have had enough."
I thought that was excellent.
In which direction are you heading,
Mr Shelby?
I am my own revolution.
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.
As do I.
Like all things regarding Ireland, it is... complex.
Yes?
Oh!
Where do you stand on the Irish question, Mr Shelby?
Never been asked it.
Then perhaps it's time you were.
Tommy, I am the people, and I have had enough.
We are looking for someone to begin a dialogue...
...with certain elements in Belfast with whom we don't officially have any dealings.
I'll be too busy singing in the House.
It would involve a promotion.
Junior Minister to the Duchy of Lancaster.
Birmingham is my concern.
Ireland bores me.
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.
Hmm.
What the fuck was that about?
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day all fucking day long.
What do you mean?
Ada, go home and start calling anyone who had dealings with Shelby Company Limited while you were in Boston.
Ask them about Michael.
Ask them <i>what</i> about him?
Who he's been seeing, who he's been meeting,
- what deals he's made.
- Why?
Ask 'em especially about people he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.
Tommy, why don't you come back with me, eh?
You can play chess with Karl.
I'll make some calls, you can listen in.
Drive home tomorrow.
That bastard starts talking about Irish whiskey.
The fuck does he know? Eh?
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.
My chair. My throne.
People thinking I'm gonna fall, they start behaving in a different way around you.
Who thinks that?
They start to circle.
Who's going to take the throne, eh?
Linda, she wants some for Arthur,
Aberama Gold, people in the north,
Michael...
Just go home, make some calls.
Protestants are coming, I think.
I need to get back to Birmingham.
Polly.
Are you armed?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you please consider putting your weapons behind the bar in case feelings begin to run high?
Behind the bar, Poll, eh?
Behind my own bar, yeah?
I prefer it there.
Thomas?
I had a dream...
...about a black cat last night, Poll.
A black cat dream means there is a traitor close by.
It was you who taught me that.
Black cat can mean lots of things.
Can mean you're hurting yourself.
Betraying yourself.
Are you seeing things, Thomas?
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am. Very clearly.
Coming from every fucking direction.
Tommy.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
I would also like to, er, say something.
- Sit down, Michael.
- I betrayed you.
- Michael.
- But only in my heart.
There was a time, in America, and there was a lot of money in that bank.
And I wondered if I could... I could leave, move to California.
Someone said I should invest in pictures.
Hollywood.
But Gina stopped me.
- Gina said...
- I told you to sit down, Michael.
Now, tell me...
...what happened on that ship in Belfast harbour.
On the journey back from New York, we got married.
But we needed to find a witness.
A purser.
He was from Belfast.
We got friendly.
What happened when the ship docked?
This purser had friends who ran a whiskey distillery in County Tyrone.
They wanted a way of getting their stuff into America.
So I said, "OK, invite them aboard."
When they came in, I realised that they didn't make whiskey.
They were Scottish. From Glasgow.
Couldn't understood a fucking word they were saying.
They started swearing, so I asked Gina to leave.
That was when they started talking about you, Tom.
They said that Tommy Shelby was a spent force, that politics had got to him...
...that he was spent in the head, that now was a good time to move in and did I want to be part of it.
They knew about the money we lost in America.
They said that you were going to blame me.
That you had a bullet with my name on it.
What did you say, Michael?
I didn't have time to say anything.
Coppers came on board.
Well, I thought they were coppers.
They, er...
They were IRA.
Exactly.
And the first men from Glasgow?
The IRA commander said the men from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.
Fucking Billy Boys.
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.
They run every man in every coalmine, on every shipyard east of Glasgow.
Ties with Belfast, UVF.
Protestant razor gang.
They also dabble in politics.
You know, muscle for fascist rallies.
But you did no deal, Michael?
You didn't even know who they were?
I was too busy looking forward to giving you the good news.
The reason Gina and I got married on the ship was because Gina is pregnant.
You're going to be a grandmother.
OK, Michael.
I believe you.
Welcome home.
Congratulations.
Just remember...
Your unborn child has witnessed what you said.
- Thomas!
- And it will be born according to...
You fuck!
Where the fuck are you going, hmm?
Are you fucking mad, hmm?
- You are free to fucking leave, Michael.
- You fucking bastard.
But you're not free, Michael, are you?
You lost this company a lot of money.
I told you to sell...
...but you held on, and now I want you to pay me back what you owe me.
There is work you can do, there are risks you can take.
We were close before.
Now I want you closer still.
Michael, honey.
Look at your cousin.
He's in trouble, huh?
He needs you.
Come on, baby, let's go.
Fucking cheek of her, eh?
Mad Dog Jimmy.
Coming south.
Not so mad any more.
He's got friends in high places these days.
Black cat dream is never wrong, brother. â™ª Hello, hello, we are the Billy Boys â™ª Hello, hello, we are the Billy Boys â™ª We're up to our knees in Fenian blood
Surrender or you'll die â™ª We are the Brigton Derry Billy Boys. â™ª
Drop the peashooter, son.
A broken broom stops all Gypsy curses, Mr Gold.
Ah!
Who the fuck are you?
Did you not hear my song?
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.
And me?
I'm Jimmy.
Ah, fuck, fuck.
Good.
Mouth broke, so you can't talk.
But you don't need to.
Your body will be the lesson.
You work in a particular capacity for Mr Thomas Shelby, OBE.
Am I right?
I heard you're a fighter.
The best.
But your fighting days are over.
Because I need Mr Shelby to understand...
...that his best...
...is not... good enough.
Bonnie!
Farewell, fighter boy. You died well.
Bonnie...
Bonnie!
Tell Tommy Shelby it's time to fucking share.
We'll take all the tracks out as far as Nottingham.
We'll take Cheltenham as well.
Otherwise, it will be Thomas Shelby who's crucified, and there will be no resurrection.
Come on, boys. â™ª But when you're crying â™ª You bring out the rain
So stop your crying... â™ª
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to take a short break. Thank you.
Yeah. Good man.
Beautiful, Billy, beautiful.
Really nice. Really nice.
Really meaningful, you know?
A heartfelt song.
I like it. I really do.
Boys, this here is Billy Grade.
Man I was telling you about, son.
- Billy, this here's my kid brother, Finn.
- Hey.
Have a drink, Billy.
I can't, my voice is...
Drink, Bill.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You boys won't remember...
...but I remember when Billy here made a living on the football pitch.
Oh, yeah, that was a long time ago,
Mr Shelby.
- Yeah, what a left foot, eh?
- Yeah.
And then what? Manager, right? Hmm?
Well, yeah, and now I'm a singer.
Are you?
Every football team in England knows Billy Grade.
And he knows a few people, too.
Don't you, Bill, eh? Hmm?
- One or two.
- Useful.
Very useful.
But what do you do, Bill, eh?
Hmm?
You're in here, singing - or whatever the fuck you call it - in shit-hole pubs in Birmingham.
It's no way to make a living, boys.
- Degrading.
- I love it.
I really do, I love it.
And thank you, by the way, for inviting me here tonight.
I really appreciate it, so thank you very much.
Don't thank me.
I didn't invite you here to sing.
If I wanted to listen to music,
I'd buy an Al Jolson record. Hmm?
That's what I'd do.
Real singer, you know?
Melody.
Tune.
So what is it that you want... exactly?
Finn will explain the nature of my proposition.
You'll listen to him, won't you, Bill, eh?
- You'll be attentive, won't you?
- Yeah, of course, course.
Because Isiah here, he'll show you the fucking consequences if you don't.
All right?
I'll leave you with the bottle, hmm?
What proposition?
Right, what I want from you, Billy, is for you to write down a name and a number next to every one of those football teams, yeah?
- Why?
- Why?
People like to bet on those kind of things these days.
- We are a gambling enterprise.
- I know who you are.
To fix a horse race, you give the outsider a bit of cocaine.
- Jesus!
- To fix a football match, you give the goalkeeper Â£20.
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Billy.
Hmm?
What have you got there?
I've written a letter.
Oh.
Who for?
For you.
And Lizzie's written one to Tommy.
Well...
...can I read it?
It's not finished yet.
I'm getting rid of the parts
I wrote when I was drunk.
By the way, I've stopped drinking.
And your bottles of snow
I poured down the lavatory.
When I was drunk, I was too hard on you.
It's... it's not your fault.
So...
That letter's about me, is it?
Yeah.
- Hmm.
- And about me.
About the future. About the company.
Lizzie and I...
Sat here and made things worse the last few hours, hmm?
Yeah, and we've come up with a plan.
Oh, you've come up with a plan, eh?
Lizzie says Tommy won't live two more years if he carries on like this.
He's gone too far.
Is that what Lizzie says, hmm?
Really now?
Well, how far has he gone, hmm, Linda?
How far?
He's lost all the legitimate money in America.
No. No, that was Michael.
He's fixing races. He's fixing football.
Following the financial crisis, the Shelby Company Limited has to find other sources of cash income.
Tommy went into Chinatown.
He's selling out the Communists to the British intelligence.
And all the time, every day, he gets more and more famous.
But that's OK.
Because if anyone puts two and two together...
That wasn't us.
It's not fucking us!
It's going to blow up, Arthur!
It can't sustain.
- You know it.
- Oh, yeah? And what do you know, eh?
You've worked it all out.
You and fucking Lizzie, eh?
Got it all planned out, is that right?
And I tell you, all you're gonna do is you're gonna be the good fucking wife.
Yeah, like the perfect couple.
We'll go upstairs, hmm?
We'll go upstairs.
Yeah, make love, hmm?
I spent my day writing two letters and deciding which one to give.
Looks like I'll have to give the other one.
What other one?
What fucking other one?!
What did you do with my letter?
I burnt it.
So did Arthur.
- Did you read it first?
- Yes.
That's more than Arthur did.
Didn't help that you can't fucking spell.
I left school too early.
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?
Do you want to fuck?
Didn't think so.
- You don't want to eat?
- No.
- You've got calls?
- Yeah.
It's Ruby's birthday today, Tommy.
Do you know why I took her to Arthur's?
Because she said she's scared of you.
When she knows you're not coming home, she's a different kid.
But I've bought a cake.
And I want you there.
We're in the drawing room.
Lizzie...
I'm in a room...
...and they're coming at me.
It's OK. I want 'em to.
Last thing I want is silence.
Standing up there, in silence, and someone says...
..."Sorry about all that noise.
"Sorry about all that... dust.
"Sorry about all that mud.
"And all that fucking blood."
And you say, "Don't be sorry.
"Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."
You want me to write this down?
Do you want me to write you a fucking letter?
Me and Arthur can't write it down...
...cos they haven't invented the fucking words.
We don't have the fucking words.
And the worst thing is...
...could've stayed at school.
But we volunteered.
Still don't have the fucking words.
Should you choose to depart, Tommy, either by your own hand or someone else's, the person who would take your place is me.
Legally.
Financially.
Everything.
I need to know there'll be something left.
Well, you know, Lizzie, in my head,
I still pay you for it, so...
...good luck with me.
I have business. â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª Happy birthday to you... â™ª
Yeah, I wanna ask you some questions...
...about the night you met Michael Gray.
Make a wish.
Yeah!
OK, kids, come on, let's go to bed.
Quickly.
- Why?
- Who's coming?
That's the thing, Charles, we don't know.
We never know.
Tommy!
- Get out of the fucking car.
- Don't!
Get out of the fucking car now, or I'll open fire!
If you're looking for traitors, there's one... with his ribs mashed up.
The man's gone fucking mad, Tom!
You did this?
With one arm and a hammer.
And a mighty pain... and a mighty fury!
They killed him.
My son!
They shot him and they put him up on a fucking cross, and he's fucking dead!
Who did?
Only Johnny Dogs and his kin knew where we were camped.
No, Tom. No.
I swear to God, I never told a soul.
- Get the fuck away!
- I never told a fucking soul.
How could you fucking do this?!
My fucking son!
They fucking took him from me!
My only... son!
Johnny!
Tommy!
Your shoulder is shattered.
If you don't get it fixed, you'll lose your arm.
He's gone! Fucking killed him!
Fucking son! My own fucking kin!
Listen to me!
How can a one-armed man avenge the death of his son, eh?
They crucified my son...
...for you.
Get away from my house! All of you!
Get away from my child!
This is my house.
And I don't want you back.
I don't want you back!
If you want to take on the Billy Boys, you need me alive.
Everyone fucking needs me.
Call an ambulance, or a man will lose his arm.
Come on, Johnny.
Come on.
Tom...
I'm no black cat, Tom.
I know, Johnny. I know.
In all the world, of all of the people, you alone I know I can trust.
My name is Captain Swing, calling from the occupied Six Counties.
<i>This Michael, your kin,</i> making deals with the very men who want you dead.
What happened on that ship?
Said the men from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.
Protestant razor gang.
They run every man east of Glasgow.
We have a mutual acquaintance.
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.
I'm Jimmy.
<i>I need Mr Shelby to understand that his best is not good enough.</i>
<i>Your body will be the lesson.</i>
Tommy, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.
My chair. My throne.
People think that I'm gonna fall, they start to circle.
Who's gonna take the throne, eh?
<i>Black cat dreams are never wrong.</i>
They crucified my son...
...for you.
Good morning, sisters.
Let us pray.
Our Father, who art in heaven...
...but deliver us from evil...
...for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever...
...Amen.
You wanted to speak to us, Mr Shelby?
Yeah.
- All of us?
- Yeah.
At 6.30 in the morning?
Yes.
- We don't smoke in here.
- Well, I fucking do.
Nor do we use language.
Nor do we find fault in the innocent.
Yet you do.
You fucking do.
May I ask what this meeting is about?
The Grace Shelby Foundation is the biggest single source of funding for this charitable institution, devoted to the care of the orphaned girls of south Birmingham, yeah?
For which we give thanks.
Uh-huh.
I have a temper similar to the one described in that report.
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.
Whose report?
The testimony of children.
Who have they spoken to?
- You'd have them only speak to God.
- God be their witness.
There is God, and there are the Peaky Blinders.
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small Heath.
We are much, much closer at hand than God.
And we have heard terrible things.
We have in this place children of the worst sort.
They lie as easily as breathe.
You had a child half black, you made her wash with a different soap.
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.
<i>Our</i> sins...
Our sins against the beating of children with bricks and hoses.
<i>Our</i> sins.
Our sins...
...against a black child who hanged herself for fear of your temper.
- I do not see how...
- You do not see!
Now put 'em on.
Put 'em on your face, or it'll be your eyes that are broken.
Please don't imagine that I won't use this minute to do it, or that I am afraid of your prayers or your crosses.
You see the world broken.
Like those beaten children will.
Now look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me!
Funding withdrawn.
All children to be taken into our own institutions.
You have no say in where the children...
If I come for you, and I still might yet decide to come for you,
I will wear high heels so you can hear my approach on the cobblestones, and have time to repent.
You listen for my footsteps.
Happy birthday, Pol.
They grow grand in the horse shit, Pol.
Curly, pour some beer, eh?
The train to London leaves in an hour.
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with me.
Tommy, I have to take Gina to the hospital today.
A week ago, one of our most trusted men was killed by Jimmy McCavern.
The man we're gonna speak to in London is establishing a relationship with Jimmy McCavern.
So cancel your appointments, and Ada can take Gina to the hospital.
That's what women do.
And clean that shit off your shoes before you get in my car, eh?
Michael, they will give it and give it until your case is proven, and then they'll take it.
From you, but mainly from me.
Polly, you go to the hospital and speak to Aberama Gold.
You tell him there is a strategy in place to avenge the death of his son, so not to do anything rash.
And take with you the heartfelt condolences of the whole family.
Why me?
Because Aberama Gold is in love with you.
He even got a haircut.
And the smell of your perfume might help ease his pain.
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.
45 years old and still breaking hearts, eh?
- Yeah!
- To Polly!
Polly Gray, hmm?
Polly.
Happy Birthday, Pol, yeah?
Curly, organise a wagon to take
Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves from the gym to burn with his body.
Michael, turn the Bentley around, you've a train to catch.
And don't forget to wipe that shit off your shoes, eh?
Just start up the car and drive.
So, what's the strategy?
You can smile.
You... don't smile.
Nice.
Very nice, Tom.
Hmm.
Although, I must say, I thought your office would be bigger than this.
It will be.
Michael, you sit.
Arthur, you stand by the window.
So, who are we meeting?
The man we're about to meet is the Minister for the Duchy of Lancaster.
He's also deputy to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Cabinet adviser to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
You've both met bad men before.
The man we're about to meet is the devil.
Yep.
Send him in.
I never seem to get to meet you without your family.
I understand you know a man called Jimmy McCavern.
May I take a cigarette?
Please.
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?
Over the last 12 months, you've been making approaches to various men across the country who you think might be able to help you in your cause.
McCavern is one of these men.
He runs the east Glasgow shipyards.
He killed an associate of mine.
I want to know what your strategy is.
That one's your brother, yes?
Yes, and I'm his business adviser.
We would like to talk business.
Michael.
Michael Gray.
You lost all your cousin's money in America playing the fool.
A nightclub in Detroit called the Gladiator was your regular.
You lost the money...
...and found a wife there.
And poor old Arthur Shelby standing there at the window is afraid his wife will never return.
My spies tell me she's been seen with another man.
Arthur...
Arthur.
And bingo.
20 seconds in, and I have them speaking their wog lingo.
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.
I <i>will</i> have need of men like you.
Except, of course, there is no other man like you.
You, in particular, I need.
But, please, don't imagine I would trouble myself with turf wars.
You have many enemies.
Shuffle the pack and pick another card.
That investigation of the dead journalist, the queer...
I've made that go away.
Read it and, uh, come back to me.
Next time, bring only an open mind and a cigar to celebrate our union.
What the fuck was that all about, Tom?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Arthur!
Do <i>not</i> let them get inside your head.
That's exactly how these people work.
Who the fuck are these people, hmm?
Who the fuck are they?!
I've just been invited...
...to become the deputy leader of a brand-new political party.
These people say they are the future.
Do you want a drink?
I've stopped.
So, what have you decided?
I've been talking to the Friends.
- What friends?
- Quakers.
Friends who meet at the meeting house in Bournville.
I'm staying in Bournville.
And what do they say?
They say I've been led astray.
If you've come to talk about redemption, you're talking to the wrong person.
I also went to a solicitor.
They heard my name was Shelby, and suddenly they were too busy.
To divorce a Shelby man, you have to go to a solicitor in London.
I found one.
He said he'd represent me.
But I put the phone down.
Not through fear.
I chose this life, it didn't choose me.
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is a man.
He listens to me when I talk.
His wife died of the Spanish flu.
He has a daughter.
And you're considering making this daughter an orphan?
Nothing has happened.
Nor will it.
He would die without his eyes.
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter a place in one of his institutions for orphaned girls.
Or even take her into the family.
And it would begin again.
What is the thing, Linda?
The thing you can't put aside?
It's not Arthur.
It's who I am when he's there.
God hears every filthy word in my head, knows every dirty thing.
And your Friends don't use filthy words?
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.
Perhaps it's what you deserve, with your filthy words.
I used to fuck seven men a day, and now I'm learning how to ride a horse side-saddle.
There's good and there's evil.
There's both mixed.
And that's Arthur and you... and me?
You don't get what you deserve, you get what you take.
What about him?
He's making up his mind.
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.
Yes or no?
Yes.
I've come to take you to the clinic.
I already told Michael - my husband or no-one.
I've got a car.
They have taxis, even in this fucking city.
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat, they're gonna give you options.
None of them are nice.
I had my check-up three days ago.
They heard a beating heart.
But if they had told me that baby had died inside of me,
I would have wanted someone with me.
My husband may do as he's told, but, er, I don't.
Look, if they hear a heartbeat, you won't need anybody with you, cos you'll have the baby with you.
So I will leave you alone.
But if you get in a taxi in this city and they hear your accent, they'll take you on a grand tour.
Come on.
- So, when will Mum be home?
- She said she had to go to Birmingham.
- Do you want me to cook you something?
- Cook?
You're a man.
This is really not fair.
Your mother never told me you were this good.
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.
I beat people even older than you.
Even older than me?
At school, some of the children say that black people and Jews are worse.
Worse than what?
Than anything.
And one teacher,
Mr Hudson, he calls my friend a little Jew boy.
Karl, these days, there are some very stupid people saying some very stupid things.
OK?
What do you think?
Checkmate.
I think I don't want you to be my dad.
Cos my dad's white... and he's in heaven.
I came to see you in hospital to tell you there's a strategy in place, not to break you out.
Don't worry, my sister will look after me.
You must stay here, and you'll let Tommy deal with the men who killed your son.
You're 45 today.
I'm probably a bit older than that.
Probably.
I've dealt death.
Now death has dealt with me.
I have one more killing to do then I'll be done.
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.
Get a car and a driver.
Find out where the Fury family are camped.
I need their men to help me.
I'll need my hunting rifle, 50 bullets.
I'm going to Scotland.
Tonight.
I was expecting Ada.
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?
I was meant to meet her today, but she said had to go to Birmingham.
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.
She's doing my job for me.
Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?
He went to buy an ice cream.
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.
- You knew I'd be here?
- Yeah, we knew you'd be here.
We have some business for you.
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby, is meant to be strictly confidential.
Ah, Michael.
You still have shit on your shoes.
My associate here can evidently smell it.
I don't mean any offence.
Here, Michael, go and find Karl and buy him an ice cream, eh?
The man doesn't trust you.
Fuck you, Tom.
You know Gina phoned.
The baby's heart's beating strong.
And I swear to God, Tom, by the time that baby draws its first breath, you and I will be done.
And you will be king.
Is that it, Michael?
You know, Tom, there are doctors in London now who can talk their way into your head, dig out all the shit.
Perhaps, you should see one.
You're still not alone.
Me brother and I are the same person.
Here.
Here's a letter from Mosley.
You should read it.
What investigation is he talking about?
Two weeks ago, a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.
The night before, he'd come to me about some story he was going to write about me.
We had nothing to do with that killing.
Mosley wants you as his deputy?
His constituency is Smethwick.
It borders my own.
He wants Birmingham as his stronghold.
He knows I've... strong support among working people.
We help him out at rallies, show up at some town hall meetings.
Right, and why are you showing this letter to me?
A Minister of State who may have seditious intentions.
There's no proof of sedition in this letter.
You work in intelligence, Younger.
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.
My brief is specifically to gather information on the activities of communists.
Your immediate superior in the intelligence unit is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?
I understand he regularly plays polo with Oswald Mosley.
They share membership of various clubs in London and Birmingham.
I have specific orders.
I am a soldier.
You think you can join this family?
I have no intention of joining a family.
Well, thank fuck for that, cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.
Thought you said this was about business.
Yes - family business and government business, all in one envelope.
Younger, listen to me.
Forget about Ada.
Forget about weddings.
You know what Mosley represents.
You know his philosophy.
I am planning to reply to him and tell him that I'm making up my mind.
But in the meantime, you need to give me instruction.
I could fight him on my own, if I have to, or I could join his organisation and undermine him on behalf of the King.
But you need to make a decision.
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.
On your fucking feet.
Hello, Tom.
I thought you were staying over in London.
Hello, Johnny.
How are you, eh?
How are your ribs?
You managing?
- Just about Tom, yeah.
- Yeah? Good.
And who's that?
Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?
Ah! Sandra.
Well, may I say, your breakfasts are a great improvement.
Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, Sandra.
The only way to get fired from this household is through burnt toast...
...or talking to the police.
Go on, go to bed.
And Sandra...
...everything Johnny said is lies.
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...
While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.
A cousin of Aberama Gold galloped from Meriden.
He said Aberama wants you to know that he's gone to Scotland to deal with his business himself, and that you'd know what that meant.
Fuck!
The boy said Aberama arrived from the hospital in Polly's Bentley.
She fucking helped him.
She fucking helped him.
But it can't be love, cos it's Polly.
Cos it's fucking Polly.
All right, Johnny,
I have a job for you.
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.
I need you to go and find Aberama Gold.
He has kin on the Lothian border, the Fury family.
Ah, for fuck's sake, Tom!
The Furys, they don't even use words to fucking talk.
Just hand gestures and fucking howls.
You will go to them and you will find him.
Tom, I am in fucking pain here.
- Yeah, you appear to be managing.
- I said I was <i>just</i> managing.
Well, you can just manage to sit in a car with Arthur and follow the patrin to find the Fury family.
Arthur will take care of everything that requires bones and muscles.
I warned you, Tom.
The Golds'll be the death of one of us.
And it looks like it's gonna be fucking me!
Well, go on, open it.
So...
...you heard the baby's heartbeat today.
Beats so fast.
Would have been a birthday gift enough.
A new life.
Liberty.
Freedom.
Feels like a weapon.
I only came because Michael's driving back from London and he said he didn't want you to be on your own.
So...
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?
Mine.
You want to take Michael and the baby to New York?
Yes.
The baby will have two grandmothers.
The other one lives...
The other one lives amongst human beings.
The other one <i>is</i> a human being.
It's all right, I'm not drunk.
I'm just free.
So, what do you want?
My approval?
Your help.
Michael wants you to come with us.
We can all live in Long Island, right on the beach.
Isn't Long Island in Australia?
Or is it in California, amongst the Indians?
It's in New York, Polly.
You see, we all try and get away.
But we never do.
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.
You're starting to sound a little sorry for yourself.
I'm an American.
We don't just go round and round and round.
We go in a straight line.
And my baby... will be born in New York.
I'm not happy about moving this meeting to licensed premises.
You've saved your union the train fare, and you hate London anyway.
We're looking for popular speakers for our upcoming rally.
You're making quite a name for yourself in the Commons.
Betty!
What are you drinking?
Water.
Bottle of Champagne, Betty.
You'll drink it on your own.
That's the idea.
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?
Revolution.
So, how is life as a socialist?
This glass.
The bubbles.
They rise to the top.
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.
That is a very peculiar form of socialism.
And this bottle.
Once the cork comes out...
...you can't get it back in.
You need to finish what you started.
It's cleverness, that's all.
So you're playing at this.
People can be turned around.
Even your people.
<i>- My</i> people?
- Yeah.
For them, it's just the same.
Communism. Fascism.
For most people, it's an apple and an apple.
Fascism is the subject of the rally.
I want you to speak against it.
In answer to your question...
...I cannot address your rally...
...because it's not part of the current strategy.
Are you OK, Thomas?
Do you want a man to carry you home?
I knew we should not have had this meeting on licensed premises.
Happy or sad, Thomas?
I warn you, I'll break your heart.
I didn't expect you home.
Frances said Linda was here today.
Frances has a very specific loyalty, doesn't she?
Well, people are loyal to those who pay their wages.
Also, Maggie at the exchange said you made some calls.
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?
He said he'd represent me.
But I put the phone down.
There and then, I made a decision.
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.
You said, in your head, you still pay for it.
So I've decided to continue to take the payment and balance my heart against my head, as though it were a book of accounts.
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!
When was the last time you had to worry about shillings, eh?
People are loyal to those who pay their wages.
That's why I'll be loyal to you.
But this is the deal.
You don't fuck anybody else in my house, nor within a day of holding our child by the hand.
A day on either side.
And you let me in sometimes.
Into your head.
To clear it out.
That what needs clearing out.
Agreed.
And this...
Always.
The deal is...
...you belong to me.
My property.
No-one touches my property.
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway.
So that's why I put the phone down.
No, Tom.
We do it in the bed at least.
Everything is mine, Lizzie.
Everything.
Arthur.
<i>- Hmm?</i>
- Frances was right.
Linda was here today.
Fuck.
What did she say, huh?
- I just want to talk to her, that's all.
<i>- Arthur, listen.</i>
<i>First, I need you to go to Scotland</i>
<i>and bring back Aberama Gold.</i>
<i>Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.</i>
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>I'll keep calling you, Tom.</i>
You know I will.
I'll call this number back...
...again, again and again.
If you don't answer,
I'll jump in my fucking car and I'll drive to your house, you know I will.
I'll stay there all night if I have to.
<i>I won't go nowhere...</i>
<i>not Scotland...</i>
<i>till you tell me what it is you know.</i>
Right, listen to me.
I don't have an address.
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.
<i>Apparently, there is someone who is a Friend.</i>
He had a wife who died from Spanish flu in 1918.
And he has a daughter.
<i>That should be enough to find him.</i>
<i>Arthur...</i>
Just talk to him and get a message to Linda.
Nothing happened, Arthur.
He's a Quaker, a Friend.
They're not like us, they talk.
Oh, I'll speak to him.
Man to man.
<i>And then, after that...</i>
<i>...I'll go up north, hmm.</i>
Deal with our business.
I promise you.
<i>Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...</i>
Who were you talking to?
I have to ask you, cos Maggie at the exchange won't tell me.
Who was it?
Was it Arthur?
I need my brother in one piece.
Arthur makes his own decisions.
You marry a Shelby, you stay fucking married.
Fuck.
Well, look at this, hmm.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I think you can.
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.
Do you know her?
Eh? I'm Arthur.
Her husband.
If you're her husband, she doesn't want to talk to you.
Well, look at you.
Ain't you smart?
Eh?
What, you got all the fucking answers, have you?
Well, let's try you with another one. Eh?
Let's try you with another one.
How about...
How about we search for the fucking truth within, hmm?
Let's have a look, eh? Let's have a look.
See what we've got inside here, eh?
You fucking bastard!
Eh? You wanna keep looking, eh?
Hey,
I wanna ask you again.
Eh? Eh?
I'll ask you again.
Where is she? Eh?
Where is she?
- Eh? Eh?
- No. No, no, no...
I'm a good man.
I'm a fucking good man, like you.
A God-fearing man.
There is good in my heart.
There is good in my heart!
But my hands...
These hands belong to the devil.
The fucking devil!
Wait... Who are you?
Did she come back?
No.
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?
No, she's not in fucking Scotland,
Charlie.
Whiskey.
We want whiskey.
Maps.
Cigars.
Load the van, we want it all.
Who's we?
Me and Johnny Dogs.
Ah.
So it's you and Johnny Dogs against Scotland?
You know, at the BSA, our friends could get you some of them new artillery cannons that fire ten shells a second.
You can mount one on the roof of your fucking car.
Petrol.
We need petrol.
It's so far up north, they run out of the bloody stuff.
Yeah.
Still riding round on fucking chariots, they are.
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland, so he needs hand grenades.
How many?
Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.
Our friends at the BSA still have lots left from the war, but we can't give them...
Get me some hand grenades, Curly, eh?
Hmm?
You find 'em back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?
You get me some.
Put them on my account.
Yeah.
How many?
- Three, Curly.
- Three. Three.
Find a way of getting her back, Arthur.
Without her, you're as good as dead already.
That's them, the Billy Boys!
Gentlemen.
You have just crossed the border into the County of East Tollcross.
Now, according to the unwritten constitution of Tollcross County,
Gypsies, Catholics and other criminally minded individuals are not allowed to work the roads of our Protestant district on account of the poor quality of their labour.
So, my own boys will be taking over from here.
We will be needing your tools, your tar, your burner...
...and your transportation.
You're Gypsies, you can easily steal another.
I have the keys to the truck.
Ah!
Now...
...I want you boys to take a message back to Jimmy McCavern.
You killed my son.
You hoisted him on a cross!
Now, in this gun...
...there's a bullet and on it is carved the name McCavern.
And when the time comes for his crucifixion, it will be me who drives in the nails.
Mr Shelby!
At last you are alone.
I think we'll make quite the team.
The pheasants won't know what hit them.
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.
You were in the yeomanry, yes?
Were you cavalry?
You won the Distinguished Service Medal.
That'll help.
With what?
Two months ago, I was in Rome.
I met Mr Mussolini.
You and I and men like him...
...we will shape the future.
When will you resign from the Labour Party?
The day before I announce the formation of my new party.
The British Union of Fascists will be born on January 1st of next year.
The first day of a new decade.
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.
Did you bring that cigar?
Before we smoke...
...I have some conditions.
It really isn't going to be that kind of relationship.
Just smoke like the fine man you will become.
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.
I have an allocated confidential line - code 78.
It's me.
I've agreed to work with our friend.
He's gonna announce on January 1st.
I need to know that my position as informant against him is officially sanctioned.
Today, gentlemen, we are avenging an unprovoked attack on members of our organisation who were simply carrying out a routine border patrol.
Our enemies are Gypsies, members of a race destined for natural eradication anyway, due to what the scientists call selection.
And since these beggars are unchristened and unregistered, the local constabulary will as soon drop them in a communal grave as find a name for a gravestone.
So proceed in any manner you choose to find the fugitive we seek.
Morning, Mr Gold.
Yeah.
The Billy Boys are coming for you.
How the fuck did you find me?
- How the fuck did <i>they</i> find me?
- I kind of let it slip.
Give you no choice, eh?
What, hmm? What?
And a Bentley outside, the engine running.
Fastest engine in the world, apparently, which is good.
We've got two minutes to get out of here.
We are officers of the East Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.
We are seeking a man by the name of Aberama Gold.
Hand the gentleman over, and no-one else will be harmed.
Fuck! Take cover!
So, Tommy Shelby...
...it's war you want...
...it's war you shall have.
You've both met bad men before.
The man we're about to meet is the devil.
Michael Gray.
You lost all your cousin's money in America playing the fool.
And poor old Arthur Shelby is afraid his wife will never return.
There's a bullet, and on it is carved the name McCavern.
It's war you want, it's war you shall have.
I've been talking to the Friends.
One of the Friends is a man.
He would die without his eyes.
These hands belong to the devil!
By the time that baby draws its first breath, you and I will be done.
You will be king.
Happy or sad, Tommy?
Mr Shelby.
My bullets ache to get inside your tinker head. â™ª Up to our knees in Fenian blood â™ª Surrender or you'll die â™ª We are the Brigton Derry Billy Boys. â™ª
You know, it's a pity.
I was looking forward to killing you.
You're at the back of a long queue.
My white flag is a flag of truce.
Yours is more a flag of surrender.
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern, the colour is the same.
The outcome is the same.
I believe we've friends in common.
We should postpone our war.
Your brother left me a hand grenade.
He sends his apologies.
You left me land mines.
For which I too apologise.
Then peace it is.
Your message said you wanted to seal our truce with some business.
Since we're men of similar interests and distribution networks,
I thought we might use our temporary settlement for our mutual benefit.
You stand in a yard full of scrap metal and stolen goods, and you talk like a politician.
No, nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.
Charlie simply finds things before they're lost.
The nature of the deal is explained in my proposal.
I've booked you a suite at the Midland Hotel.
If you need anything in this city, just mention my name.
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?
Isiah.
Also in the envelope is a cheque for Â£500.
For your wife.
She can use it to buy a black dress, rent a black horse with black feathers to pull a black carriage with your body in it, should you break the terms of the white flag.
Now, please, enjoy the city it's my honour to represent.
This week I've managed to get to the people at York and Lincoln City.
I mean, they're the teams that are losing.
I got to them.
Right, go on. Go on, take your time.
Mm.
I got to the goalkeepers, they all said Â£5 is enough.
I, erm...
I've written to the people at Tranmere Rovers because the phone you put into my... into my house stopped working.
So I'm gonna need another one of those.
OK.
Once we've got that fixed, hey, then we'll have all the names and numbers of the First Division referees.
The First?
Yeah.
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Come on, come on. Come on.
Listen, listen to me. Come on now.
No need for that. Hm?
Yeah.
We need you to find out what they like.
You know, what gets them going.
Cos a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.
We need you to find out what they really like playing.
Yes.
See, cos we can offer them that.
Oh, yeah. Shelby Company Limited, we can offer them all the lovely things people like.
Hm?
We can also offer 'em protection from the things they don't like.
You ever touch my family...
...ever...
York.
Lincoln.
- Lincoln?
- Hm.
Tranmere Rovers.
Hm?
Mm-hm.
- Bye, Finn.
- Goodbye, brother.
Shit.
It's all right, Mrs Connors.
You can carry on. It's just my brother.
So tell me how it happened?
They were sleeping downstairs.
And then my husband came home...
...drunk from the Marquis, even though he just lost his job.
We don't have any money.
Anyway, he came to bed.
But downstairs, they must have heard a noise.
They woke up.
They started, er, calling out.
They woke my husband up, and...
...when he's drunk, you don't wake him up.
What happened then, Mrs Connors?
He, erm...
He...
He went downstairs.
He killed them.
Strangled them. All three of them.
And you've, erm... You've... you've brought their bodies here today with you.
Proof, Mr Shelby.
Their singing was the only pretty thing in my life.
I don't care my husband beats me...
...but not this.
Mrs Connors.
We have your address.
We will speak to your husband.
My brother here will go to the Bull Ring market today, and buy you three new goldfinches, and have them delivered to your door.
The same colours and, you know, feathers.
The new ones I will call
Thomas, Arthur and Finn.
That'll make him pause, even when he's drunk.
Good day, Mr Shelby.
You take care, Mrs Connors.
Bye.
I don't know how you do this, Tom.
I really don't!
You learn things, Arthur.
That woman has only two rooms downstairs.
Her husband has lost his job and he beats her.
And yet, the thing that brings her to see her Member of Parliament is songbirds.
Now, that's politics, Arthur.
It's not for me.
Anyway, look.
That list of losers.
How much have we made on the football?
Ten grand this week.
Finn showing promise, Tom.
Maybe we should put him on the tracks.
Just a thought.
- Finn.
- Yeah.
- Your lunchtime delivery.
- Bring her in.
Tommy, the next fella wants to see both of you.
- Do you know his face?
- No. He's Chinese.
Chinese in our pub?
Tom...
All right.
Slowly, Micky, let him in.
Three little birds, eh,
Tommy, Finn and Arthur.
Mr Thomas.
Mr Arthur.
My name is Brilliant Chang.
Brilliant Chang is dead.
Perhaps.
Sometimes I wonder,
"Is this heaven?"
Doesn't smell like heaven...
...so I would say I have survived.
- What happened to Maggie?
- You don't like me?
I like everything.
I like fucking everything.
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.
Micky, bring that phone here now.
Hello?
<i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>
I sent a woman with a gun to your youngest brother's office.
All right, Finn.
<i>Right, right.</i>
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>
Do you want to die again, Chang? Huh?
Good.
The guns are pointed.
Now we are all concentrating.
The moment is now pure.
Purity is not necessary.
Displays are not necessary.
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."
When you walked through that door, it was open.
You don't need to do anything to get my attention.
Now, what exactly do you want?
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...
...you die.
If you die here today, we'll bury you face down with no hands.
- You'll go straight to hell.
- I don't care about rituals.
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.
Well, tell your friend on the phone to put her gun down and we can all have a talk.
Hold your fire, brother!
Hold your fire!
I'm all right.
She fired into the ceiling.
Finn's all right.
Finn's OK.
Give me your order! Mm.
Give me your order, Tommy!
Yes or no.
At ease.
I said at ease.
May I take something from my pocket, Mr Shelby?
And it's the purest opium that has ever arrived in Europe.
No salt, no flour, no lies.
Pure truth.
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i> out of Shanghai.
Docked at Poplar a week ago.
The stevedores were held at gunpoint,
Chinese unloaded the cargo by the light of lanterns.
A foreman at the dock estimated there was seven tonnes of the stuff.
I made a note at the time.
I spoke to that particular foreman and I worked out that seven tonnes of pure opium crystals would be worth...
...approximately, Â£1,190,000 on international markets.
The big crash. Hm?
Wall Street.
Now we all keep our ears open for opportunities.
- What the fuck is going on?
- What are you playing at?
Finn, we are conducting a piece of business.
She had a gun to my fucking head!
But your trousers are dry.
You didn't piss yourself.
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.
You had a dispute with a lady and you didn't piss yourself.
And Arthur here tells me we should put you on the tracks.
Gonna be a good day for you after all,
Finn.
Give me that!
Hey!
Always have your whores searched at the door.
If I see that bitch on the street,
I'll fucking cut her.
Yeah, all right. All right, come on.
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.
A gesture of goodwill.
I'll throw it in the canal.
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here, but the location is part of the deal.
What fucking deal?
How does it feel to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?
Four boats.
Four days.
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.
Half the cargo is coal and underneath the coal, pure opium crystal.
Opium.
I vote against it.
They can't use trucks because the Chinese drivers get stopped by the police.
They need to get it out of London because all the warehouses are being searched by Customs.
The seven tonnes is bound for San Francisco, but the outward ship doesn't sail for seven days from Liverpool.
They need somewhere safe to store it.
All we have to do is take it up the canal and keep it here for a week.
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.
Ask yourself, would he turn down Â£250,000 to drive four boats up the canal with no prospect of inspection?
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?
That's half of what Michael lost in Chicago.
I will ask him to take charge of this business.
Michael's position will be reinstated in the company?
His period of quarantine would be over.
Think about it, brother.
Four boats sailing up the cut, smelling of wood smoke and bacon.
And which one of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends do you trust, Tom, eh, with a cargo worth Â£1 million?
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.
Let's vote.
Those in favour.
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats and four tonnes of coal before it gets dark.
They sail south tonight.
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring and get them three songbirds, Arthur.
Yes, Tommy.
Fuck!
What have you heard, Pol?
The man you cut went to the police...
...but we dealt with it.
Is she with him?
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.
But they say his face is so badly cut he's hard to look at.
So I would say not.
I would also say it is time to give up on Linda, find someone else who might be able to put your fires out.
I can't, though, Pol.
I fucking can't!
And that's it.
That's it.
Whiskey?
Thank you, no.
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.
I've already got a time and a place for the killing.
You see?
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.
A girl called Karen who hates him, who will give him up.
I have the sound of cranes and winches to cover the gunshot.
I've got a Bentley to get me away.
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.
When that business is done, he's all yours.
You can avenge the death of your son in any way you see fit.
You mean when <i>you</i> say.
When you check that little stopwatch you've got that controls the turning of the Earth.
Yeah.
And then you will marry and you will settle.
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?
Just let me understand you.
Do you mean that Polly is part of this deal?
Yeah.
Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE, does your vanity have no limits?
I believe it is called the ego these days.
I read books.
You sit on your throne and you instruct Polly Gray, who is of far richer blood than you, as to when she can and when she can't marry.
Oh, no, she instructs herself.
She has her own strategies.
And we are of the same blood.
She will marry you, but only if you agree to postpone any attack on McCavern until this business is done.
So she <i>is</i> some young Gypsy bride that's yours to give away.
Young she is, when she's barefoot on the cobbles.
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way, well, you know, you throw in a few coloured ponies or...
I'm having an event at my house.
You are invited.
Polly will be there.
There will be candles and violins and dancing.
Polly wants you to propose in the proper way, and then she will give you her terms of acceptance.
Inviting you for this purpose was Polly's idea.
- You can't read?
- I don't read.
- It's <i>Swan Lake.</i>
- Ballet?
Yeah.
Apparently, it's about love.
Polly says that, for now, love must defeat revenge.
...As a result of the greed and the excess of a small number of bankers, financiers and other feckless gamblers.
This comprehensive document, pleading for Government intervention in all areas of economic life, represents not just socialism, but a new breed of National Socialism.
And I believe... I believe that the leaders of my own party have been very foolish to reject it.
How on earth did you get a ballet company to come to your bloody house?
It's an independent dance company dedicated to bringing ballet to the people.
We share a philosophy.
I'm a patron.
I also gave them a lot of money.
Oh.
And this date is your wife's birthday.
Yeah.
The party is for her.
And she likes ballet, your wife?
Why wouldn't she?
It's just...
Well, you see,
I did some research into her.
Into her past.
If you want to buy her a gift, she likes diamonds.
Now that we are going to be conquering the world together, we need to have no secrets.
We should know each other's weaknesses.
Your wife has led an interesting life.
It may even be possible that, as a younger man in Birmingham,
I came across her.
My friends and I would sometimes go to nightclubs in the south of town.
Well, if you recognise her, maybe you can talk about old times, eh?
Maybe, if we have met before, your wife and I could even renew our acquaintance.
I am invited to stay the night, yes?
I too have done some research,
Sir Oswald.
Yeah.
I researched your wife and your wife's younger sister and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon, all of whom you are fucking.
If such things were to take place on a narrowboat, the Church would get involved.
But...
...it's not happening on a narrowboat.
No. It's taking place in your apartment, in your country house, sometimes even in your office here in the House of Commons.
So no secrets. And, yes, yes, you are invited to stay the night with whichever member of your family finds favour.
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,
I need to lock up my office.
Actually, I will come alone.
In society, you are judged by your hospitality.
I will expect adventure.
Such rogues we are, aren't we?
Sing like songbirds in the House.
And then, afterwards, relieve ourselves in the bodies of whomever we choose.
Two men for whom forbidding is forbidden.
It should be quite the party.
You have to listen to the voices that you hear.
Do what they tell you to do.
You don't even have to rub the lamp any more to summon the genie.
It wasn't the blue stone, Tommy.
It was you.
It was you.
Who is it?
It's Tommy's car outside.
It's him. I'll get it.
What's happened?
Nothing's happened. I'm all right.
Come in.
Do you want a drink?
- No.
- No?
No. I have some information for the intelligence officer...
...on conversations with Mosley.
He's planning to put forward proposals for building works.
He, erm...
He wants the Communists to consider his new party as fraternal, which means his activities are now part of your official remit? Yeah?
Mr Shelby, it's 2am.
You can make your report any time.
- Why don't you stay tonight?
- No.
I'll leave you two to...
Yes, good night.
I stood on a bridge tonight, Ada.
And I looked down.
And Grace was there...
...but she was still alive.
Tom, have you still been taking laudanum?
The fucking name of the barge was the <i>January.</i>
Our dad's boat.
The boat I was born on.
We've never got nothing.
We've never got nothing.
And we never fucking will.
Dr Brooke said that you never arrived for your appointment, Tom.
No.
There's nothing in his books of any use to a man like me.
They talk about guilt.
Eh?
Guilt! What fucking guilt?
- The black barge.
- No. No, that's not it.
That's not it. He had it right.
Mosley had it right.
He said, "Forbidding is forbidden to us.
"We can do anything.
Nothing can stop us."
But there's a part of me that is unfamiliar to myself.
And I keep finding myself there.
And only the <i>January</i> can get me away.
Will you at least try the doctors again, Tom?
Well, then at least throw away your opium.
It's that that causes the visions.
Just... throw it away.
While it's there, it's a temptation.
How much have you got left?
Seven tonnes.
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.
You do me a favour?
When that kid of yours arrives, keep it away from me.
A fucking ballet.
He wants to impress someone.
And I'm invited?
You and Gina.
Why?
Because he wants to give you the chance to come back properly.
Coal haulage?
Yeah.
Tommy wants you to reopen those books and become managing director.
So I've come back from Detroit to become a coal man?
The first delivery is bound for San Francisco, but if it works...
...Tommy thinks he can find distribution for it here.
And this, erm, this coal...
- ...is it snow white?
- No.
Golden brown.
Fuck.
This is your opportunity, Michael.
There is more money in this than there is in all the other parts of our business put together.
Tommy knows what opium does to people.
Tommy knows what whiskey does to people.
He got an OBE for selling it.
I'll speak to Gina.
You'll what?
I will consult my wife.
Your father ran this business for a bit.
And he shipped coal. Real coal.
Just coal.
And his fingernails and his eyelids and his ears were black with it.
And the merchants would offer them one price and then only pay half because they could.
And <i>that</i> was wrong, Michael.
Run your hands through it, get it under your skin...
...and then see if Gina will let you lay a finger on her.
I think golden brown is more to her taste.
Especially when you tell her how much money you're going to earn.
Now we're in business together,
I should ask, which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?
I have no religion.
Some nights I wish I had.
He's kin?
Yeah.
And the simple fellow?
He's a lot less simple than you might at first think.
Do you trust them?
Right. So I take a boatload.
No.
Ten sacks to start with, so you can test the market.
Then we'll deal in boatloads.
Cash payment on loading.
For that amount, it'll have to be a cheque.
I don't take cheques.
It'll be a cheque.
I will take a cheque if it's guaranteed by our mutual friend in London,
Mr Mosley.
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?
Yeah, who'd have thought, eh, Charlie?
Who would have thought it?
Aye, but you're OK.
Yeah, I'm only OK until I'm not OK.
Then I'm really not.
Delivery in seven days.
Cheque guaranteed.
Won't your Chinese friends expect the seven tonnes that leaves London to still be seven tonnes when it reaches Liverpool?
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.
Oh, you mean you're bold enough to skim the Chinese?
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.
When you've unpacked, there should be a girl laid on for you.
Mr Shelby is a socialist and believes in equality of service for all classes.
According to the invitation, there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.
Say that you're feeling tired and we'll leave.
Well, if you see a duke, introduce me.
My God, at last!
Something you like about England.
Gina, I've been made an offer.
To come back into the company.
Michael, we agreed, the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?
The job is haulage.
Supply. Transport.
Opium.
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!
Tommy has made contact with Chinese suppliers who have plantations in the Afghan hills.
Pure grade.
We will take delivery and ship it all over Europe.
You mean heroin?
Yes.
And how much would you make?
Conservative estimate, three shipments a year from Shanghai, seven tonnes each, stand to make approximately
Â£1 million.
Per annum.
The company will make three.
We could go to New York whenever we wanted.
On our own fucking plane.
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.
For Â£1 million a year, we do.
What happens if you get caught?
Tommy has friends.
If the ship gets stopped, it'll be the Chinese who hang.
Think about it, Gina.
When we move into our house...
...our room for entertaining will be twice this size.
Will it now?
The magazines say that it's all straight lines and simplicity in the 1930s.
Deco is dead.
We'll be able to afford dukes and duchesses.
And maybe...
...maybe a princess or two.
And the painting on the wall will be of you.
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone and it will be Michael Gray arranging the ballet.
Where will Tommy be?
Where he wants to go to most.
Ah.
There.
A lord.
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?
Tommy...
My house.
My wife.
Let 'em wait.
Sir Oswald.
Do I not get announced?
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you that he's busy with the catering preparations and will be joining you shortly.
In the meantime, and while you're waiting, we have opium, cocaine and brandy.
I don't use opium or cocaine, and brandy is for after dinner, not before.
I also have a list of options for the end of the evening.
You'll notice that the maids wear name tags.
We hired them specially...
...for those guests staying the night.
All things are available except the ballerinas.
And who, might I ask, are you?
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.
And I too am unavailable.
Lizzie.
There's something I didn't tell you about this evening.
Something about our guest.
Mosley.
It's possible that...
...that you've met him before.
Before when?
Before you became who you are.
Would you even remember him?
Would he remember you?
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.
I wasn't taking cash.
Lizzie...
There's a pile of bodies...
...floating by.
Let 'em go, Lizzie.
Let 'em go.
So that's why you brought me in here.
To lay your claim.
Yeah.
Well, it's a start, I suppose.
He lays a fucking hand on you, he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.
You were indisposed when I arrived.
In society, you greet a guest, you don't leave them hanging...
...looking around like a fucking dog.
Before we join the others, I have some business.
I need a signature.
By the way, your brandy before dinner thing amuses me, but none of the maids are of interest.
And I despise the use of drugs.
Your strategies are very transparent.
I'm involved in a transaction with Jimmy McCavern, your acquaintance from the north.
I have no idea who you mean.
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.
I need your signature as a guarantor on the transaction should his cheque fail to be honoured.
The sum is Â£10,000.
And what is it he's buying from you?
A gin distillery.
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.
Hmm.
So not only is the truce holding, but you two are actually doing business.
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.
If I sign a cheque guarantee for this man, it is proof of a connection between me and him.
Something you could later use against me.
Why would I want to move against you?
You're curious about my weaknesses.
And you've learned it's not cocaine, not maids.
But now you will learn my weakness is a tendency to trust people.
Do you have a pen?
Mr Shelby.
I know you have no classical education, but just realised you are the perfect balance between the gods
Dionysus and Apollo.
Irrational frenzy controlled by reason and self reflection.
Do you know the work of Friedrich Nietzsche?
- No.
- Freud?
Yes.
Ah.
There.
Your guarantee of trust.
Now perhaps you would introduce me to your wonderful wife.
So, did you know?
What?
Oh, that tonight's special guest might have fucked you when you were a nightclub hostess?
Yeah.
Lizzie, if we were to strike from our guest lists every man in Birmingham who you...
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.
Shit.
Sir Oswald, this is my wife Elizabeth.
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.
Since we all appear to know, and since knowledge is permission,
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit of our honest relationship, you won't mind me saying it was a bottle of Champagne and an evening well spent.
Actually, it was an evening wasted.
For the Champagne and brandy you bought me, as I recall, it was the booze that put you to sleep a little prematurely.
Ladies and gentlemen, the dance is about to begin.
Mr Mosley!
A toast, if I may.
To the end of our deal, and the beginning of something more.
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.
This way.
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen, will you marry me, a poor commoner who loves you?
Let's fuck before the swan dies.
I heard there was a family occasion.
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.
That animal inside me, it comes out and I can't stop it.
Fuck, Linda.
Without you, I c...
Come inside, please.
His name was Frederick.
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.
He just listened.
And now he has no face.
He's as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside.
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...
...in fucking hell.
Arthur...
<i>My name is Brilliant Chang.</i>
Mr Thomas...
...it is the purest opium that has ever arrived in Europe.
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i> out of Shanghai.
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.
Canals are the idea, right, Chang?
I believe we've friends in common.
We should postpone our war.
Your message said you wanted to seal our truce with some business.
I'm involved in a transaction with Jimmy McCavern.
I need your signature as a guarantor on the transaction should his cheque fail to be honoured.
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.
<i>There's a part of me that is unfamiliar to myself</i>
<i>and I keep finding myself there.</i>
<i>And only the</i> January
<i>can get me away.</i>
His name was Frederick.
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.
He just listened.
And now he has no face.
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...
- Clear that shit. Clear it!
- All right.
Take her.
Go outside. Till it's done.
Till it's done, brother.
Linda, I would have taken your bullet.
I deserved the bullet.
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!
Linda!
Linda, look at me.
Linda, you've got a kid.
If you die, he'll come to us to raise.
You hear me?
I used a derringer.
- Shh!
- Right.
- Shh!
- It's still in there.
It's above the bone.
Mr Shelby, your guests.
Get him out. Arthur!
Family only. Get him out!
- Mr Shelby...
- Get out!
Get out!
Lizzie, go to the kitchen and get some iodine. Now! Go!
Shh...
Linda...
You'll have to bite on this.
- Linda... Arthur.
- Bite! Come here.
Now, it's really gonna hurt.
One, two, three...
You're all right. You're all right.
- It's all over.
- Hold her.
Is she going to be all right, Tom?
Is she going to be all right, Tom?
Yeah.
Oh, Jesus.
Arthur, come here. Come here.
If you love her, go to the library, get some opium.
- Go on. She'll be fine. Go sort it.
- Right.
Actually, you can use mine.
Brought a bit to celebrate the wedding proposal.
Oh! He proposed, eh?
One knee.
Congratulations, Poll.
Linda...
Linda...
- You're gonna have to drink this.
- No.
I don't want anything you've touched.
25 seconds. 25 seconds and the pain will be gone.
Even the pain in your head.
Right, here you go. Drink.
Cushion, Poll.
Right.
Oh, Jesus Christ...
Arthur...
She's gonna be fine.
I gave her something to get her to sleep.
She's gonna be fine.
You should have... You should have let her do it, Poll.
You should have let her do it.
Arthur...
You should have let her do it.
Look at me, brother! Look at me!
You've got things to do.
You've got a kid.
- Yeah.
- We need you!
- All right? You understand?
- Yeah.
Aberama wants you as best man.
You hear that?
I save his life, he hugs him.
Oh...
I'll do it.
No take.
Right, fine. Let him be. Let him be.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I would like to extend our gratitude to the musicians and the dance company for your wonderful performance.
Hear hear!
This has been a wonderful evening.
And not only for the music and the dancing.
It has also been about us, the people gathered here.
English people in the very heart of England.
There are no people
I would rather be among, no place I would rather be and no time I would rather be alive, because ever since the terrible events of October, when the money markets betrayed us all...
...I have known that change is coming.
The human species has never faced such immense possibilities, such choices.
In the lives of great nations...
...there are moments of destiny...
...which have swept aside small men of convention and discovered men of the moment.
- Hear hear!
- And our host is such a man.
For him...
For him, the little calculations of little men mean nothing.
He is a man well suited to the mighty mood that England is now in.
The only reason I say this now, at this moment, on this stage, is because I have some news.
Good news, I think.
I'm sure our host will forgive me if I use this platform, this gathering of friends and like minds, to give you, his trusted allies, an early announcement of a long-overdue event.
I want to tell you good folk first...
...that with the dawn of a new decade...
...I will be setting a new course.
Setting up a new political movement here in the very heart of England.
And Mr Shelby will be with me, shoulder to shoulder.
Hear hear!
It will offer a new conception of politics in which the great character of the British, our true character, will be reborn.
Many of you lost fortunes in the recent stock market crash.
The men of money, the capitalists in New York, the Jews...
...the money-power, they... they run an international system in which the infinite mobility of money, its capacity to create financial chaos and panic, can bring down any government that dares for one moment to oppose it.
For generations, the efforts of hard-working men like you have equipped our competitors against us.
The cotton mills of India.
The cotton mills of Asia.
Created with British money but used for the destruction of Lancashire and Yorkshire!
Disgraceful!
The usurers of New York, the sweated labour of the Orient combining to destroy the iron and steel factories of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.
These are policies that could not be pursued by British statesmen unless they were mad or the servants of Jewish finance!
<i>They</i> are the ones who took your money, but it is I and those who know this truth who will light a flame the atheists cannot extinguish!
The ranks of our heroes of the Great War have been betrayed again and again by politicians!
But hear this - those of you who fought the Jew war for nothing, you brave men, you will join hands with the angry youth of Birmingham and Manchester and London and Liverpool and declare that England lives tonight and marches on!
Well said!
I say all this to you now...
...because I believe it is in places like this, with people like you, that we will have to pass on our message directly.
Our message can be summarised with these words -
Britain first.
And because this is our message,
I doubt it'll be reported fairly in the press.
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country are owned by the same vested interests who took your money.
They sell to the people false news...
...to raise the interests of the faction and the section above the interests of the nation.
- Good man!
- So hear my words and pass them on to those with ears to hear.
And be reminded that when the new decade begins, there will be the birth of a new political party which will speak <i>for</i> you.
Well said, sir.
Well said!
This party, this new movement, this revolution...
...will be called the British Union of Fascists.
Bravo!
Good man!
What the fuck are you doing, dealing with a man like that, Tommy?
Yep.
You're going to have to trust me.
Again.
I'm going to fuck the swan.
Somebody go and tell her to come to my room.
How do you know she'll come?
Because they always do.
Now, forgive me.
I'm going to borrow your husband for a little while.
This way.
Things like tonight, that shooting, a family dispute in public, things like that will have to stop.
It's very lower class.
It's all been cleared up, Mr Mosley.
So, did you learn anything from my speech tonight?
Yes.
Yes, I learned many things.
Religion was a beast, but it's dead.
You have to ride the new thing when it comes.
Like a horse.
You grab it.
I looked into the audience and I saw medals and Savile Row suits, and bitterness.
<i>They</i> are my people.
Your people will be different.
Oh, do see the funny side, Shelby.
I do.
I do see the funny side.
Do you enjoy strategies?
Yes, I do.
Things will begin to happen now.
So...
...there are some things we need to discuss.
I've been looking into your companies.
The Shelby portfolio.
Your company lawyer is a Jew.
He will have to go.
Of course.
Also, our friend Jimmy McCavern has asked for control of the racecourses north of Wincanton.
I decided it is a trifling thing, considering our new enterprise, so I said yes.
In return for what?
No return.
None.
When our campaign begins, the country will be divided into distinct areas.
McCavern and his men will be our soldiers in the north, controlling rallies and breaking up demonstrations.
In the Midlands, it'll be you.
The south... Well, I have yet to decide.
Please understand what I'm offering you as we go forward, Mr Shelby.
When we succeed, even the King will not be above us.
Power.
Like plugging into the mains.
A lighthouse beam.
Your millions of dollars safe in Switzerland, and access to every dirty-minded swan in England.
Oh, and also, Shelby... drink less.
Put it on.
Put the costume back on.
The ballerina and I were wondering whether perhaps...
...you might want to join us.
If I told Tommy, you wouldn't see the morning.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
You see, he is being seduced, just as you were.
Tommy.
Tommy!
- Tom!
- What?
Lizzie... What?!
Tommy, I swear to God, you're bad.
That man is fucking evil.
Lizzie...
I'm only doing this...
...to bring the bastard down.
Yeah, but why?
Tommy? Why?
I am supplying the British Government with information on his organisation, and in return, they are giving me favourable terms on defence contracts.
No.
You're doing it because you think somebody should stop him.
I saw your face when he was speaking.
You're doing it because you think it's the right thing to do.
All this time, you just did things that feel nice...
...because you can afford it.
Lizzie, please. Please. Please stop.
Don't scare me...
...by saying you see things in my face.
I still want things that feel nice.
Linda...
Shh. Shh.
Linda...
Let's go.
Hmm?
Let's go, let's leave.
Let's get in the car.
We'll go and pick up Billy.
We'll drive to the docks.
Any dock you want.
We'll get on a boat.
We'll sail away.
You and me.
Any destination.
Be careful, it's...
It's broken everywhere.
We leave tonight. Hmm?
We'd leave this place.
We never come back, Linda.
We never come back.
I mean that.
We go before it gets light.
Say yes.
I've got a better idea.
You stay here...
...living inside your head.
Inside your life. Inside your war.
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.
It would have been a kindness.
Now get out.
Please...
An evening with a bunch of fucking Gypsies.
Peter! Peter! Kick it here!
Kick it here, mister!
This is a cheque guarantee, signed by Mosley...
...on behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.
A cheque for what?
Well, I said it was for the sale of a gin distillery.
But it doesn't matter.
It is direct evidence of a link between Mosley and the head of an organised criminal network.
A relationship he will try to deny...
...after the bonfire of all conventions.
It also contains the names of MPs who have signed up to the movement, and those MPs who are sympathetic but will not show their hand until the organisation is announced officially.
On 2nd January.
In Grosvenor House. You might want to write some of this down.
I am experiencing resistance from my superior officers too.
This isn't intelligence, Younger.
This is evidence.
Give it to the Branch.
Special Branch?
Half of whom spend their lives defending the Union against Fenians, and the other half who spend their lives defending men like Mosley against socialists.
I heard about his speech at your house the other night.
Was favourably reported as the passionate and spontaneous outpouring of a man moved by the emotions of a ballet.
Reported where?
<i>Daily Mail. Morning Post.
Daily Mirror.</i>
It's upper, middle and working class, all united in admiration.
Also, I'm being asked the source of my information on Mosley.
Which you don't divulge?
No.
And as a result, my six-monthly review was unfavourable.
They're talking about moving me to a black and coloured desk in Johannesburg.
I also suspect there are specific threats to me personally from an organisation called Section D.
I believe you've had a dispute with them in the past.
Sit down, Younger.
Yeech...
We are now Section D.
And I fucking beat them.
You're a soldier, I'm a soldier.
There are elements within the state who are prepared to kill.
We need to meet them unafraid.
Spoken like a true believer.
My superiors also ask why the information on Jessie Eden and the Communists has apparently dried up.
Why has it dried up, Mr Shelby?
Your sister has an interesting theory.
She thinks perhaps at last
Tommy Shelby has actually started to believe in something.
Younger.
Please don't listen to my sister's opinions of me.
They are always... hopeful.
Therefore they are always wrong.
Can you hear me? Look at me.
You're going to be all right.
I'll be back.
You'll be OK.
Look at me. Look at me.
It's OK.
Fuck!
Call an ambulance!
Call Moss!
Find out where I can reach Ada.
Come on, love.
Up you get. Good girl.
Come on, take her. Take her.
Come on. Up you get. Up you get.
Good boy.
Come on.
In you go. Inside. Stay inside.
Tommy?
Let's sit down, Ada.
What's happened?
Here, sit down, eh?
Ben Younger is dead.
Someone put a bomb in his car.
I don't know how you felt about him or how bad this is gonna hurt...
...but whatever happens, just remember you've a baby inside of you.
Oh, God.
Anyone you touch...
Which means anyone I touch.
Which means anyone any of us touch.
He never knew I was pregnant.
I hadn't told him.
I didn't love him.
But I liked him.
He was decent and good...
I wasn't gonna marry him.
The baby was a mistake, but that's OK.
I didn't ask anything of him.
God, he didn't deserve us.
Well, I've spoken to his family - they're gonna take care of the funeral.
It will go down as an IRA assassination of a British military officer.
And what was it really?
It was...
...a consequence of good intentions.
My good intentions.
I pushed him to report on the fascists.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
And as a result,
Section D or the Branch or Intelligence had him killed.
There was a kid...
...died in the explosion.
He was ten years old.
It's funny...
...isn't it, how it works?
Look, Tommy.
Don't give yourself this excuse.
He was ten years old.
If I'd have stuck to what I do, he'd still be kicking a ball in the street.
It's funny, isn't it?
Push the button.
Unlock the door and come home to me.
Chinese lanterns. Brass on deck.
God fucking help us.
Chang will be waiting at the dock with the cargo.
We weigh it, we load it, we fuck off.
Where the fuck is Chang?
Isiah, take point.
Look lively.
Right, there's your lanterns.
Where the fuck are the Chinese?
All right, Charlie.
Arthur, it's Chang!
Christ!
Get over! Get over. Get over!
I knew we shouldn't trust these fuckers and their fucking lanterns.
If it's the police, hold fire.
Chang, where's the stuff? Where is it?
They didn't look like police.
Smelt of gin.
They said they were taking the opium on behalf of the King.
Then they saw your boat coming.
So, were they Italian?
- Were they Italian?
- Irish.
Irish, I think...
Oh, fuck.
Fuck! Charlie, my gun. Give me the gun.
Give it up, that's it.
Listen. Listen to me.
They're Titanic boys out there, right?
They're out of Poplar.
In the war, they were very capable.
Very capable soldiers.
So was I.
I was a fucking capable soldier, too.
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastards!
Arthur! Arthur!
Stop firing! Arthur, they've gone.
To any of you still alive, you do not fuck with the Peaky fucking Blinders!
Huh!
Yeah.
Here we go.
Chang?
Purest ever in Europe.
Arthur?
There's a dead man in a copper's uniform.
Should I throw him in the cut?
No.
No, he'll float, won't he, eh?
Even Irishmen fucking float.
No, go and fire... go and fire the kilns.
But there are men working them.
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?
And razor blades in your cap?
Cos you're a Peaky fucking Blinder, that's why.
You take that body and you burn it to the bone.
And if anybody speaks to you on that...
...you offer them the chance to burn in that furnace with him.
Right?
Yes, Arthur.
Yeah. Yeah.
Do we know the people who tried to trick us?
The uncles will be mad.
Fuck your uncles.
And your aunts, your cousins, all of them, right?
Curly! Load this up onto the boat.
Let's get back to Birmingham, eh?
Get back to fucking civilisation and find out who's been talking.
Yeah! Now look, the Titanic heard about this, right?
That means every gang from Poplar to Birmingham will want to be here.
Well, let 'em come, eh?
Let 'em come, Aberama.
Yeah.
Oh, let 'em fucking come!
Hat and coat off.
Stand up against the wall.
For your own safety, I need to search you for items that could potentially be used as weapons against you.
Oh, that's nice.
He was my friend.
Yeah, well, he's nobody's friend any more.
He's a fucking animal.
Laces out of your shoes.
Table.
Barney? Visitor.
This one's real.
You can wait here.
No. I can't.
It's your funeral.
- I'll have to lock you in.
- Yeah.
Hello, Barney.
Arthur says to say hello.
Sergeant Major?
You're alive?
Arthur's alive, John's dead,
Danny's dead, Freddie's dead...
...Jeremiah preaches the gospel barefoot.
Yeah.
And I'm alive.
Them as have gone are the lucky ones.
Thanks for the letters you send,
Sergeant Major.
Yeah, Arthur mostly writes them.
I just... just sign them.
How the fuck do you write back?
With your fucking teeth?
No, they stick the pen up me arse.
Someone in here said your name.
They said out there you are a politician now.
Sometimes I am.
I didn't know if it was real, comrade.
I see rats coming out of bodies like at the black wood.
The shit they give me in here...
Hey, Barney, look at me.
Barney, this here is opium and cyanide.
It'll bring on a heart attack.
They won't even check the cause.
You won't feel a fucking thing.
So, here.
You're in here forever, brother.
You don't have the use of your fucking hands.
You're still in the tunnels.
I can give this to you now.
Do you want it?
No.
Why not?
I know.
I know.
You still remember...
...that French waitress.
You still going on about that, Tom?
Yeah.
Did you fuck her before me?
Because whoever did gave me the fucking clap.
But I'm guessing it was you.
- Yes, I fucked her before you did!
- Yeah.
- She was beautiful.
- She was.
She was.
And I reckon
I was second best after Barney.
Why did you bring the capsule, Tom?
You're in here, Barney, you have no hands, there is no daylight...
...and you don't wanna die.
No, I don't.
Because one day things might change.
Yeah.
Things might change.
Maybe they already have.
Come here, Barney.
Come here.
What if I could break you out of here?
Why would you break me out?
See, the trouble with the people in here is the fucking meds they keep you on.
Ten years since we were back,
Barney, ten fucking years.
Maybe the storm has passed.
Passed for you, then, has it, Tom?
What would the world do with me if I was out?
I've a job for you.
Fuck!
Barney...
Barney, you were the best fucking sniper in our company. Never missed.
I can use that man.
I'll get you the latest BSA, fucking... telescopic sights.
Who am I shooting?
Fuck do you care, Barney?
Get that fucking thing off, get you free.
- Are you all right in there?
- Grand in here.
What do you say, Barney?
I'll come for you...
...after midnight on Wednesday.
I don't keep track of days, Tom.
Don't have to.
You'll know it will be Wednesday, cos there'll be a big fucking bang.
All right.
Big fucking bang.
Big fucking bang.
Big fucking bang.
It's fucking Wednesday!
Big bang on Wednesday!
They called from the Black Boy in Knowle.
They'll be here any minute.
I hear you agreed to give up the north.
I hear... there needs to be some certainty in the south.
Some of my people were attacked by members of the Titanic, who've heard about a cargo.
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion regarding who he can rely on to offer him support in London.
Well, I would suggest the most competent organiser of men in the south...
...is Alfie Solomons.
He's dead.
And he's Jewish!
And I'd say as far as our boss is concerned, him being dead would be less of an obstacle than him being Jewish.
I think he'll give London to the Italians.
He likes Italians.
That'll mean more concessions on your part, but you're going to have to accept it, tinker boy.
I like Wincanton.
It's a grand old racecourse.
And that brother of yours, the one who left me a hand grenade...
...he'd be the first of you tinkers
I'd go for if our truce should end and the whistle blew.
Good. He's in the mood for a quarrel.
- We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.
- Yeah, I heard.
Yeah. Fun night. Got noisy, though.
And to think they all said I was mad to take me dad with me, eh?
Your dad? Who's your dad?
This is my fucking dad.
Right here.
This is my fucking dad.
Where's Aberama?
He got off at Solihull.
Said if he sees Billy Boy here...
...he'll cut his fucking throat.
Tell the tinker he's welcome to come and try it any time.
Mm.
Is it all aboard?
Yeah.
It's all there.
We weighed it at the wharf.
We used cockney scales.
I wouldn't trust 'em.
They're probably crooked.
- But, er, I reckon seven tons.
- Curly?
Put ten sacks of flour
- onto Mr McCavern's boat.
- Tom!
I-I don't think it's really flour.
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Curly?
Hey, Arthur?
Someday, yes?
You and me.
Oh, Tommy, hey?
Fascists, hmm?
Look at 'em.
I fucking hate 'em. Always have done.
But you...
You, Billy Boy...
...oh, you're special.
Y'know, I fucking like him, Tommy.
I like yer.
I do. You're a man after me own heart.
- Someday, Mr Shelby.
- Yeah.
- Someday.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
You just tell me when, Tom.
You just tell me when.
So, er...
- ...so you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?
- Yeah.
Barney Thomason...
...is gonna kill...
...Oswald Mosley, shoot him in the fucking head.
Yep.
While he's on stage.
While I'm stood next to him.
And then I will take over as leader of the party...
...and you and Aberama can take care of that bastard McCavern.
I had more complicated strategies in mind for Mr Mosley.
Then he spoke badly to my wife.
It's going to be a busy few weeks, brother.
Yeah.
There are some things we need to discuss.
Our friend Jimmy McCavern has asked for control of the racecourses north of Wincanton.
I said yes.
- In return for what?
- No return.
None.
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.
It would have been a kindness.
Now get out.
This is a cheque guarantee.
Signed by Mosley.
On behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.
<i>The consequence of good intentions.</i>
<i>My good intentions.</i>
Push the button.
Unlock the door and come home to me.
I have a job for you.
I'll come for you...
...after midnight on Wednesday.
Barney Thomason...
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.
While he's on stage.
While I'm stood next to him.
And then I will take over as leader of the party.
<i>It's going to be a busy few weeks, brother.</i>
Mmm.
You prefer Irish to Scotch?
Yes, Mr Churchill.
Irish over Scotch.
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.
And your mother was probably born in a tent.
Grandmother in a tent.
My mother on a narrow boat.
And always happy to give smart answers to men born better than you.
A man needs to prove he is better than me rather than show me his birth certificate.
You see, I don't have one, so they mean very little to me.
You speak beautifully in the House.
- Thank you.
- And believe not a word of what you are saying.
Conviction introduces emotion, which is the enemy of oratory.
You read Greek literature.
I have trouble sleeping.
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?
You are forming an alliance with a fascist.
So I made some enquiries amongst the worst people in Whitehall, and I found out that you are not forming an alliance with him at all.
You are spying on him.
Yes.
Why?
The honest answer is...
...I'm no longer sure.
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?
I have a gardener.
In fact, I have three gardeners.
Three generations of men with no ambition...
...who are happier than I will ever be.
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you that there are certain species of weed that no matter how much you tug at them, poison them, they continue to grow back.
In the end, the only solution is to plough up the topsoil, create a field of mud and blow up and burn the exposed taproots.
That's what you and I did in France.
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,
I see the green shoots of another war growing up around his feet.
And you see exactly the same thing I do.
That's why you oppose him.
Yeah.
Your mystery solved.
What is your strategy?
I won't burden you with it.
You're going to break the law.
I need to sleep.
You said you don't sleep.
I said I have trouble sleeping.
As do I.
As do I.
Mr Shelby...
...I have no doubt that there was once a time in Flanders when you were under the ground and I was above it, both working to the same end.
We are in the same exact situation here in Westminster.
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.
And if you need anything, call me.
There are some times, some nights...
...when I don't see the point of carrying on with any of it.
Oh.
That old dance routine.
I put out a cigar, and an hour later I want another.
Sometimes, the bridge between hours is as fragile as that.
But use it anyway.
A tent.
Then a boat.
Then a house.
Now a mansion.
That's something.
Isn't it?
Yeah, that is something.
By the way...
...was it you who killed that Ulsterman intelligence officer?
I forget his name.
Major Campbell.
Yes, Campbell.
No.
It was my aunt.
I really must come up to Birmingham some day and spend an evening with your family.
They sound interesting.
Yes.
They'd like that.
I got to Harold French, refereeing Liverpool.
He just wants cash.
Tom the tatter, reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash and a beating for a bloke who's screwing his wife.
The clap doctor said go easy on the whiskey, yeah?
Finn.
You don't knock?
No, Finn.
I don't knock.
Right.
Hello, Billy.
How are you, mate?
Good, Mr Shelby.
Yeah, you look good.
That's a nice suit.
Thank you, Mr Shelby.
He earned that suit.
We made more on the matches than we did on the races last Saturday.
He's a good man.
Yeah, I know that. Mm.
You're coming up in the world, I like it.
How's the missus, hmm?
The old trouble and strife, as the cockneys like to call it.
She moved out.
Oh, that's a shame.
Mind if I join you, eh?
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?
You're a good man, Billy.
You're a good man, eh?
You could sing like a bird in a cage.
And what did we do, eh?
We opened that cage, and the real man flies out, reveals himself.
The truth is young, Billy boy.
Yeah.
Here, look.
What have we got here? Oh, look.
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?
Then there's some snow there, look.
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.
Now, I know you like that, hmm?
Well, I do too.
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have a little line together?
Eh? Why don't we do a little bit of snow together?
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.
Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?
I do apologise.
And you. Hmm?
Look at you.
Sitting here with your mate, eh?
Your best mate.
Well, while you're sitting here, talking about our business, drinking whiskey, smoking and sniffing...
- Hmm?
- And working.
You remember, you tell this man about our family business...
...and it's his life you're risking.
Cos people talk, Finn.
We... we only ever talk about football and women, Mr Shelby.
Football and women, we only ever... we only ever talk about football and women.
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.
It's...
Hmm.
Yeah.
Come on.
Family meeting, let's go.
You're not eating right.
You're not eating right.
You're not getting the natural things in you, boy, that's what it is, always.
You bearing up, Arthur?
Bearing up for what?
Bearing up to being free, Pol.
Another glass, eh?
Another glass of so what.
Are you all right, Charlie?
Mad bastard Barney kicked me in the shin when I woke him up.
Where is the mad bastard?
He's tied to a lamp-post outside with three Lee boys, shitting themselves.
A drink.
First of all, an apology from Lizzie - she can't be here.
Charles has a violin concert.
Also, a welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.
He and Polly are to be married in three weeks, with my blessing.
From now on, Aberama will be welcome at our meetings.
First item of business, a bereavement.
Colonel Ben Younger, who may perhaps have become a member of this family, was taken from us, four days ago, by dark forces.
We've made some investigations, and we think we know who planted the bomb.
In the meantime, our thoughts are with Ada and the baby inside of her, who may one day sit at these meetings, but hopefully under happier circumstances.
Let's drink to happier circumstances.
Yeah.
To Ada.
- To Ada.
- Ada.
Item number two.
An announcement, regarding Michael.
Before you go on, Tommy, there's something I'd like to say to the whole family directly, regarding finances and the future of this company.
According to your own estimations, this new venture of the delivery and shipment of opium will bring into the company around Â£2 million per year.
Therefore, due to the amounts involved,
I think this company should be restructured.
Michael, I think this can wait till outside the family meeting.
Restructured in what way?
Because of the amounts of money involved, shipment and dispatch will become the primary source of income to the company.
It's simple mathematics.
And with the help of my wife,
I will organise an expansion into America, where the narcotics business is just beginning to grow.
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,
New York, Boston, who I've already spoken to about this.
And Gina has family who are very experienced in this kind of business.
According to the conversations
I've had with them, with a regular supply of pure opium from China, within a short space of time, the American narcotics business will bring in $20 million per annum.
Enough money for you to all enjoy an easing of the burden you all now feel.
See, I know that the scars and the wounds, they're on the inside, not on the outside.
And as a member of the new generation,
I'm able to take that great burden off your weary shoulders.
A new decade is coming.
There'll be new opportunities in new territories.
More money than we've ever had before.
Tommy, you can still do the good work that deep down you want to do.
Mum, you can get married and live in that big house.
Arthur, you can be the man that Linda wants you to be.
Fuck Linda.
Finn.
You've proved yourself.
You're part of the new generation.
You could come to New York with me.
Here is my proposal.
A full restructuring of the company.
I will be managing director.
And you can be nonexecutive chairman.
But under an assumed name, to protect your reputation.
I've found the name of a dead man.
You will be registered as Mr Jones.
You will each receive a percentage of the profits as an annuity, and you will no longer have to engage in any of the associated activities.
Take a look at the future, Tommy.
At least read it with an open mind.
It's cold in here, Michael.
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.
Item number three.
Tell him the truth.
Go on.
He can take it.
Tell me the truth, Michael.
The Americans don't want to deal with an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.
Those days are done.
Tommy. He's bitten through the fucking rope.
They've got him cornered, but they need help.
Go and get him!
Fuck the Americans.
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.
It's time.
And you know it.
Tommy, Mum's leaving...
...John's dead, Arthur needs help,
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard because you fucked up.
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.
Like the good old days.
Or...
...see this for what it is.
A natural succession...
...that someday must happen.
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.
Don't be here when I get back.
You.
You can tell your family...
Let me guess.
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.
Right?
Well...
...guess we're gonna be forced to take the second option.
They're not fucking voices!
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.
- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!
Barney!
Barney!
Put down the gun. At ease.
Finn.
At ease, soldier. At ease.
Look at me. You're on our side.
You're at home.
You're at home.
Yeah? Yeah.
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?
Yeah.
Take him to Charlie's yard before he falls over.
The devil will now be an angel.
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.
Come, brother.
Let me give you the good news.
Jesus loves you.
So, where the fuck is he?
All right, boys.
A subsidiary meeting of the generation that actually do the work.
Right.
Let's have the good stuff.
None of that shit ponces' drink.
Here we go, look.
All right, so item number three.
An introduction.
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.
In France, he was a comrade.
What the fuck is he now, Tom?
He's a man we can use, Johnny.
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear and take bets on the outcome?
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money on the fucking bear.
Aberama, that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile which will make his actions explicable to the police.
What actions?
A killing.
And since when did you worry about the police?
Barney Thomason...
...is gonna kill an MP.
Possibly the future prime minister of Great Britain.
What the fuck, Tom?
After the killing, there will be an investigation by Special Branch and Intelligence forces.
There will be a lot of powerful people as angry as fucking hornets.
We need there to be no connection to us.
Barney Thomason is registered as criminally insane.
He broke out. He's an old soldier.
He has known grievances.
No-one will question that the assassination was carried out by a single gunman acting alone.
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?
If they catch him, they won't hang him on grounds of insanity, just send him back to where I found him.
He'll have had a very eventful holiday that he'll probably believe never really happened.
And where will this killing take place?
There you go.
He'll be on stage.
With lots...
...of witnesses.
During the rally, there will be an anti-fascist demonstration.
Amidst the confusion, a shot will be fired.
And we're organising this demonstration?
Yeah.
Where will you be, Tom?
I'll be down on one knee, cradling his head...
...while the life drains from him.
Then I'll make a speech...
...saying how the cause he died for must continue...
...continue safe in my hands.
Holy fuck.
Tommy...
...does your ambition have no limits?
Jimmy McCavern will be running security at this event.
He'll probably be in the wings.
You can take his life whichever manner you choose.
What do you want us to do, Tom?
You and Arthur and a couple of the Lee boys, you'll be in charge of getting Barney into position.
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.
No. I will medicate him.
So he's gonna be cross-eyed when he takes the shot?
In France, he never missed...
...no matter what they gave him.
He'll have had plenty of target practice.
Before he takes the shot,
Arthur here will give him some cocaine to sharpen him up.
So just...
You're gonna be up on the stage while this criminally insane gunman filled with cocaine takes aim at a man just a yard away from you?
Welcome to the family, Aberama.
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.
After the killing, every copper in Birmingham will be sent to Bingley Hall.
Use that opportunity to get that boat full of opium up to Stourbridge locks.
There, you'll be met by some Chinese gentlemen.
They will have two suitcases full of cash.
Every man in this room will receive $30,000 in cash, in recognition of extra services.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, Tom!
Anyone who wants to leave, leave now.
Anyone who is tired of this old-fashioned, backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.
Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.
Good.
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.
Johnny, bring the van round.
What's the fire for, Tom?
There is an item number four.
It's time.
Jeez, Mr Shelby.
If I'd have known, I'd have come in early and served you drinks, huh?
Here, Micky.
Sit down there.
So I'll have a drink, will I?
Here you go, have a drink.
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.
To collect some cargo.
I was met by the Titanic boys.
They knew I was coming.
Yeah. When, where, what time.
They even knew...
...the cargo I was picking up.
Jesus.
Four days ago, Micky...
...a soldier was killed...
...outside my office...
...by a bomb.
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.
No. It weren't the IRA.
I spoke to the girls who work at the Digbeth telephone exchange.
They're friends of mine.
I asked them what calls were made around the time of the explosion.
They told me that...
...30 minutes before the explosion a call was made to a man in Sparkhill who has connections to the Ulster Volunteer Force.
He now offers his services for cash.
Paddy Rose.
Yeah, me and my brother, we spoke to Paddy.
At length.
He told us it was him that planted the bomb.
Yeah, we spoke to him.
We killed him, Micky.
Paddy Rose is dead.
We weighed him down, we sunk him...
...to the bottom of the Grand Union Canal.
The girls at the exchange gave me the number of the man that called, Micky, before the explosion.
That was your number.
Micky, it was you who called him.
You tipped him off.
You were told to call him if a black man of a certain description ever came to Small Heath.
We know you've... you've been giving the Titanic boys information as well.
We know that.
Yeah.
You've been working behind the bar, hmm?
Seeing what goes on, listening, taking notes, and selling your stories to the highest bidder. Hmm?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on, man.
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry, Mr Shelby.
Don't look at Tommy.
The ceiling would be cheaper, brother.
Micky!
Fucking hell, Arthur.
Eh?
Shaking like the hand of a normal man.
What about item five, Tom?
Huh?
There is an item five, right, Tommy?
I'm fucking sinking here, man.
I'm fucking sinking, Tom.
You... you... you said there's an item five.
Say it, Tommy.
Item five could start now, Tommy.
It could start this year, a new decade.
M-M-Michael...
Michael could be right - we could go, Tommy.
We could go.
We could fucking leave this place.
We could leave it to the kids.
Michael's... He might be right.
- He might be fucking right.
- Arthur!
There is no item number five!
Go and check that Polly is still on our side.
I have to go to Margate.
All right, Tom.
All right, brother!
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.
You out there, Tommy?
Yeah. I'm here.
I was just having some oil rubbed into the bits that really hurt, mate.
What do you think of that view, eh?
It's Margate. What can you do?
I'll tell you something, Tommy, right?
I sit all day every day in that chair, on that balcony, contemplating the fact, right, that life is so much easier to deal with when you are dead!
- Hello, Alfie.
- Yeah.
Did you... did you look through the binoculars?
Yeah.
I watch ships. No two are the same.
Yeah.
That is how God sees us both, in his eyes.
God, eh?
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you know.
Someone's responsible for all this fucking mess.
Now...
How soon did you know that I was not dead?
You wrote me a letter, Alfie.
Did I?
Yeah, you asked about your dog.
They gave me a lot of drugs at first.
Hmm. Yeah, all right.
I was lying out there, and the tide had come in, and it woke me up.
I remember looking around and thinking, you know...
..."Fuck...
"...if this is hell...
"...it looks a lot like Margate."
Maybe that's just what hell looks like, eh?
No, no, not according to this holy book right here, yeah?
It gives a very, very vivid description.
You and I are both fucked, mate.
Do you read the papers, Alfie?
No, don't be silly.
But you've heard.
What, fascism, yeah?
Three, two, one, bang.
No?
Fine.
Good Lord, your fucking condition has got worse, mate.
Mine, on the other hand,
I've been living the dream.
Sometimes, I will shoot at the side of a ship.
And sometimes I'll sit here,
I may shoot at the old seagull.
Alfie...
...I'm gonna shoot Oswald Mosley.
Right, well...
...I hope you do a better job on him than the one you done on me, yeah?
I mean, what... what were you thinking?
Was your mind somewhere else, Tommy?
Yes, it was, actually.
Yeah, all right.
Oh, look.
A ship.
Why do you want to shoot him?
I need to organise a riot, Alfie.
Right.
And I hear you still have some... standing in the Jewish community.
Let me be clear, right?
Since my resurrection,
I am considered to be a god, all right?
In the Holy Land, someone has made an image of me out of rock embedded in the sand, so I'm told, and I am planning to make a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.
Are you going to shoot him because this man is evil?
I need men who can fight.
Mosley uses men from Glasgow.
So if the men causing the trouble are Jewish it will be... explicable.
Since when did you need explanations,
Tommy?
Since I entered politics.
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And how has that been for you, Tom?
Gangs, wars, truces...
Nothing I didn't already know.
So you think if you kill him, you... you will kill the message, yeah?
I will kill the man, then I will kill the message.
How much you paying?
I thought you might do it for the cause,
Alfie.
Fuck off.
Each man will get Â£20.
You'll get Â£5,000.
You know, as a god, Tommy, right,
I am now able to just rise above those kinds of insults, mate.
Ten?
How is my dog?
Your dog is fine.
In that case, ten should be enough.
Where do you want the men?
Birmingham.
No. No.
20 will not be enough for my lads to step inside that fucking shit-hole.
It will have to be 25 at least.
25 it is.
You can take your dog back, then, eh?
No, it's better for him to think that I am still dead.
As it is also with the police.
Right.
So you're still at it, eh, Tommy?
Hmm.
You ain't got no Margate to go to.
No.
And I have no interest in shooting seagulls.
Oh, you have in shooting Cabinet ministers?
Yeah.
And their paid informants.
Mm.
I was on a lot of drugs at first, right, due to the pain, you know, on account of it...
Well, you know, being shot in the face by... some cunt.
I won't bore you with the details of the trivia.
Nonetheless, I had a recurring dream.
I saw you in a field, right?
With a big black horse.
And you said goodbye, and then... bang.
All right, then. Well, what now?
I will continue...
...till I find a man that I can't defeat.
Hmm.
Arthur asked whose side I was on.
There will be a war.
And one of you will die.
But which one, I cannot tell.
Hmm.
He's gonna do it anyway.
- Yeah.
- You should know, if Aberama takes his side,
I will kill him.
What about me?
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.
Kill... and kill.
It's the only way to make people listen.
Soon you'll have a stage to stand on.
Millions of people will listen to you.
And you will run the country like you run this family.
It appears to be what people want.
But not me.
Not any more.
My resignation.
If it's Barney you're worried about, he's sleeping.
But I can't sleep because my fucking leg is cracked.
Tell me how my mother went, Charlie.
You know.
She drowned.
I know it wasn't by accident.
Tell me the truth, Charlie.
The truth, Tommy, yeah?
The fucking truth.
Fuck's sake.
She just stepped into the canal.
Your dad was no use.
It was me trying to stop her, for three days.
In the end, she did it anyway.
- Did she say why?
- Nothing that made sense.
Tell me the things that didn't make sense.
She said it were the Gypsies made the nails for Jesus's cross.
That's why we're cursed and restless.
Yeah, go on.
You have to move around or the guilt catches up with you.
I said,
"Well, why not go on the road for a bit?"
She went to Worcester.
She came back with a white pony.
That one she gave to you.
You used to ride it round, remember?
Well, she seemed happy for a bit, watching you ride it.
And then she was gone.
None of it made any sense.
Afterwards, whenever I looked at that white pony, I saw her.
You see, I was in love with her, Tom.
No-one knew but me.
Broke my fucking heart to pull her from the cut.
You know, your grandfather, he went the same way.
Suicide.
Sometimes, these things run in the family.
Fuck family, Tom.
You just have to get on with it.
You're a Gypsy.
You have to move around, or it all catches up with you.
Didn't need all them tablets, just needed another fucking war, eh?
Perish Judah.
Perish Judah.
Shalom, my friends. Shalom.
Shalom. Shalom.
In you go, buddy.
Show these fascist bastards no mercy, brothers.
The Jew and the Gypsy united.
Look, I have got to go, yeah?
I have to go.
Go where?
They're shooting a fascist tonight.
You're gonna do what?
Ssh.
Mosley's in town.
Really?
Look, go into town, get some drink and some girl and listen to the radio.
We will not stand by and let this scum have free rein in our city!
Fascism must not be allowed to voice its creed of hatred.
Out the fucking way!
We have a right to protest!
Get back!
Anybody heckles you, beat the fuck out of them.
We have a right to protest!
We got another one. Let's go. Get, get!
Calm yourself down.
It's not against the law to protest.
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Let her go.
- I don't need the help of a fascist.
- Yes, you do.
At Steelhouse Lane, they'll do whatever they want to you.
Let her go.
I'm Tommy Shelby, and I'm ordering you to let her fucking go. Go on.
Fuck you.
Jessie, you can do more damage from the inside.
Do you understand?
You can do more damage from the inside.
Come on.
Come on.
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Shut up!
Here, look.
There, look.
I'll join you.
Play high.
Now, you know what you're doing, don't you?
Yeah. Tommy checks his pocket watch,
I count ten, then I blow the other bloke's head off.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
There, that's for after.
Thank you. Thank you.
- See you later, Arthur.
- Oh, soldier.
Soldier, you do that, you run like fuck.
- Don't stop.
- Run like fuck.
- Yeah.
- Run like fuck.
In here.
Here, for your face.
At least I have only one face.
What did you mean,
"damage from the inside"?
I have a strategy.
You always have a strategy.
But it's dangerous, and it can't be shared without sharing the danger.
You think I'm afraid?
No, but it's only gonna put you in more danger.
Jessie, before the speeches start, just go home.
There's gonna be lots of arrests.
You have a mark against your name.
Why?
What's going to happen?
I'm gonna do a good thing.
Whenever I do a good thing, innocent people get hurt.
So go home.
After this evening, we can meet, discuss strategy.
That beast out there, he's just a beast.
It's like a horse.
It's the rider that decides what direction it takes.
And who will be the rider?
Just go home.
Full?
To the fucking brim.
Trouble?
So far, a few communists.
Bullers helped our boys clear them away.
Well, a few hecklers are a good thing.
We can illustrate how we deal with opposition.
There is a rumour a gang of Jews are coming up from Digbeth.
No sign of them yet.
Well, let them come.
Welcome them appropriately.
There are a few Peaky boys around.
They are your allies.
There'll be no rifts between us.
Keep your powder dry.
Mr McCavern?
Perish Judah.
No joke, Mr McCavern.
Perish Judah.
You turn the radio on and turn up the volume.
I want to listen to the news.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
Mr Oswald Mosley.
Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah!
Welcome, men and women of Birmingham.
Thank you for coming here on this cold, dark night, in spite of the obstruction and provocation of our enemies.
Our enemies deal in bricks and stones and bottles. We deal in reasoned principle, argument and fact.
Among those enemies, we can number Mr Winston Churchill, who last night condemned me in the House as a threat to democracy.
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.
But then Mr Churchill has never been a friend of the common people.
Faced with the alternative
<i>of saying goodbye to the gold standard,</i>
<i>and therefore to his own employment,</i>
<i>he characteristically selected the latter,</i>
<i>but of course...</i>
<i>...not all attending tonight</i>
<i>will be convinced of our cause.</i>
<i>Some will have come here tonight to find out for themselves</i>
<i>what we stand for.</i>
Whenever you're ready, Tom.
So here are our guiding principles.
Every citizen shall serve the state.
Not the banks, not factions, not the Jews!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
The barriers of class will be abolished and a greater Britain will be born of the national socialist and fascist creed.
It is useless to hide from ourselves the fact that ever since 1918, when our heroes returned from France, our empire has shown all the signs of disintegration, and our people are threatened by gathering disaster.
Get out of my way!
Out of the way!
Go. Go.
Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two apple crumble...
I think it's about time we got off the stage, old man, until this thing is sorted.
The coppers are here, Arthur.
You gotta get away from the body.
What the fuck are you doing here?
What happened?
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what fucking happened.
It doesn't make any fucking sense.
Wait. Fuck, it's us.
Aberama's dead, he's gone.
He's gone, and they came for me, too.
What the fuck is she doing here?
Arthur, they got to Barney.
They knew everything.
They knew fucking everything.
Who? Who knew, Tom?
Johnny, get this woman out of here.
- I want to know.
- Yeah.
Get her out of here. Get her out!
Doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make fucking sense.
Who? Who? Who?
The Chinese, the Italians...
...the Branch, Intelligence,
McCavern, Mosley...
Mosley knew nothing!
He knew nothing!
Who?!
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're fucking frightening me, Tom.
Doesn't make sense.
Who?
Who? Who?
Who?
Who? You know, Tom, you must know.
You're fucking scaring me, what are you doing?
Talk to me.
Maybe I've found him, Arthur, the man I can't defeat.
- Mosley?
- I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
Doesn't make sense.
Let's...
Let's go inside.
We'll work it out...
- ...have a drink.
- I need to walk.
The work is all done, Tommy.
It's all done.
We can walk away from all of this.
It's so easy.
It's so soft.
Such a small change.
