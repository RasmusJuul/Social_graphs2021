i'll be in london one week, at this address.
finish your business here and join me.
<i>"dear grace...</i>
<i>"before the war, when i had an important decision to make,</i>
<i>"i used to flip a coin.</i>
...and give him peace. amen.
amen.
i promised my friend freddie thorne that i'd say a few words over his grave if he should pass before me.
i made this promise before he became me brother-in-law.
when we were in france, fighting for the king.
amen.
and in the end it wasn't war that took freddie.
--pestilence took him.
come here.
but freddie passed on his soul and his spirit to a new generation
- before he was cruelly taken.
we thought, now freddie's gone,
- you might come back to birmingham.
god, do you know how funny it is that you've got chauffeurs in uniform now?
it's just for the occasion, ada.
do you know how unfair it is that you've got four bugattis when half the country's starving?
so now they've made you ashamed of us, eh?
sometimes when i think how i used to be, it makes me embarrassed.
karl's with his cousins.
i caught 'em trying to pinch flowers off a grave.
ada.
are you coming home?
i'm going home.
it's all right, poll. we make ada embarrassed.
that's not what i said.
there's another reason we want you home.
we're planning an expansion.
- i'm taking premises in london...
tommy, it's a funeral, business can wait.
polly, if ada was weeping then i'd stop.
but she's not.
the expansion means it's going to be dangerous to be a shelby in london for a while.
yeah.
well, i'm not a shelby any more.
and i'm not a thorne now, either.
i'm free.
i've got to get karl home.
--i told you.
let me do it.
it's all right.
i'll have some men watch her house till the danger passes.
"till the danger passes"?
that'll be the bloody day.
go on, move away, go on.
it happened at, uh, exactly 7 a.m.
nobody saw anything. our patrols were not in the area.
mr shelby, have you got any idea who might've done it?
i'd say it was something to do with the gas.
it's just been fitted.
er, madam, the structure's not yet declared safe.
--madam!
this is all over the place.
confetti.
you can go.
right.
who?
who did this to us?
whiskey. irish.
i heard there was a bit of a bang in your part of town.
gas and electric don't mix.
who'd have thought they would, eh?
how's business otherwise, mr shelby?
you know something?
in these times of hunger and hardship, business is surprisingly good.
which one of you is the peaky blinder devil?
gentlemen.
finn! get in here.
finn! hold the phone. come here.
- take the odds. -yeah, sure.
polly.
did he say who did it?
he's gone to the black lion.
on his own?
tommy does everything on his own.
- should i go to the black lion? -what?
- should i go there and see him? -no.
where the fuck is arthur?
protecting the garrison's whisky from the police.
for fuck's sake!
polly, it feels a little bit to me like things are getting out of hand.
so get 'em in hand.
do you know what ada said to me this morning?
she said we all look like we work in a factory under the ground.
she said we look like ghosts.
she'll be back.
when?
when she needs us.
and anyway, who the fuck would blow up our pub?
- six. -six what?
six questions since you walked through the door.
soon you're going to have to start being the man with the answers.
why?
seven.
because when london happens, you'll have to hold up your end or we'll find somebody else who can.
--thomas shelby.
you blew up my pub.
anger defeats fear, good.
you blew up my pub.
tommy has a reputation to uphold.
a reputation for not being scared of anything.
in all the world, violent men are the easiest to deal with.
so tell me, which brand of rebel are you, eh?
i read somewhere that you paddies started fighting amongst yourselves, now.
the king offers you a peace treaty and you start a war about it.
that's funny, don't you think?
a war about peace.
so are you for the treaty or against the treaty?
forgive me, i get confused.
you are one decision away from death, mr shelby.
so stop fucking smiling.
your name is irene o'donnell.
you have a son at the cherrywood road school in harborne.
he has irons on his legs, his name is sean, he comes last in every race, poor boy.
poor boy if the race was important.
do you know what i mean, irene o'donnell?
there are other ways of carrying out this mission.
please allow me to put a bullet in this scum tinker's head.
no.
he researches his enemies, that's why he's been chosen.
i am chosen?
i'm chosen.
can the chosen one smoke?
a vacancy has appeared and you're going to fill it.
chosen by whom?
by an informed consensus.
i have things to do.
so perhaps you could tell the chosen one what he's been chosen for.
from now on, mr shelby, you shut your fucking gypsy mouth and listen to your instructions.
fuck!
i need the area round the co-operative stables clear of coppers between midnight and 4:00 tonight.
right. could i ask why?
well, whatever it is you're going to do, don't start any fires.
the firemen go out on strike at midnight.
that's all. you can go.
i've got some information you might be interested in.
no charge.
there's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.
he's, uh, just passing through, he says.
very grand these days.
he's head of some secret department, the irish desk.
so i doubt he'll be bothering with the likes of us, eh?
i'll say good night, tom.
i demand to speak to a representative!
a representative of his majesty the king!
father! father!
it was the ulsterman, the man with the wolf head!
get the fuck off me!
you must reconcile yourself with the fate that awaits.
i demand to speak to a representative of his majesty the king!
make your peace with god.
a representative of his majesty the king!
- father. -come on.
now, wait! where are you going?
does someone here have business with the king?
major campbell.
--about time.
i am a very busy man, governor.
in seven and a half minutes, the man in that cell is due to be hanged for murder.
the murder of an irish activist in whitechapel.
does the case ring any bells, major campbell?
no, governor,
i hear no bells.
since yesterday morning, he's been claiming that the murder was ordered by the british secret intelligence service.
it's a little late to be coming up with nonsense like that, don't you think?
he was told if he kept his mouth shut there would be a last-minute pardon, which has not materialised.
forgive me, governor, but what business is this of mine?
he says the man who hired him was an intelligence service chief of staff, an ulsterman.
carries a cane with a wolf-head handle, a bullet wound in his right leg.
no.
still no bells. governor, you have a very clear remit.
part of that remit is to oversee the smooth completion of executions sanctioned by the crown.
and in the next four minutes it is your duty to escort that man to the gates of hell.
is that clear?
and if you should ever have the desire to discuss this matter with anyone else
i know where you live.
arthur, tommy's called a family meeting.
arthur!
he just beat the shit out of an apprentice.
i had to take half the kid away in buckets.
arthur.
come on.
sit down, finn.
- where the bloody hell is tommy? -he's on his way.
all right then, while we're waiting patiently...
whisky.
left over from the explosion.
it's good stuff, as well.
right.
before tommy gets here,
i think there's a few things we need to get straight between the rest of us.
you think?
yeah.
yeah, i do. i want to know...
when did we all take a vote on this expansion south?
you have anything to say, you wait for thomas.
polly's fucking right.
i see all the books.
legal and off track.
sort of stuff you don't see.
and in the past year the shelby company limited has been making â£150 a day.
right? a fucking day!
sometimes more.
so what i want to know is why are we changing things?
polly, look what's happened already.
we haven't even set foot in london yet and they've already blown up our fucking pub.
- who said anything about cockneys? -who else?
do you know who did it, do you?
- no, she doesn't know who did it.
i'm told only family are allowed to speak.
everyone's allowed to speak.
on your feet, esme, let's hear what you have to say.
i speak for our household.
- so... -john, this company is a modern enterprise and believes in equal rights for women.
on your feet, esme.
i'm not a blood member of this family but perhaps, indeed, because i'm not a member
i can see things in a different light.
so i'll get to my point.
that would be nice.
as my husband said,
shelby company limited is now very successful.
--but london...
i have kin in shepherd's bush and portobello.
it's more like wars between armies down there.
and the coppers fight side-by-side with them.
and there are foreigners of every description and the use of bombs is the least of it.
i have a child, blessed with the shelby family good looks.
i want john to see him grow up.
i want us to someday live somewhere with fresh air and trees and keep chickens or something.
but london is just smoke and trouble, thomas.
thomas?
that's all i have to say.
that was a lot of words, a lot of words.
wash them down with a nice drink.
thank you, esme.
firstly, the bang in the pub had nothing to do with london.
understood?
the bang is something i'm dealing with on my own.
secondly, we've nothing to fear from the proposed business expansion so long as we stick together.
and after the first few weeks, nine tenths of what we do in london will be legal.
the other tenth is in good hands. isn't that right, arthur?
that's right.
now, some of you in this room have expressed your reservations.
fair enough.
any of you who want no part in the future of this company, walk out the door...
right now.
go raise your chickens.
for those of you with ambition the expansion process begins tomorrow.
tomorrow?
i'm company treasurer, you should speak to me first.
it's newmarket tomorrow, third busiest day of the year.
we have 18 staff.
who you trust with 200 quid takings?
oh, i changed the combination.
--so what's going on, thomas?
who'd you meet at the black lion?
give me the combination, polly.
polly, give me the combination.
what happened to the pub is irish business.
we're in a situation where, for everyone's safety, it's best if some things remain undisclosed.
so why tomorrow?
like you say, tomorrow's newmarket.
all the london bosses will be at the races.
what say you just roll up and take the city?
no, we take the opportunity to show our hand.
the italian gangs and the jewish gangs have been at war in london for six months.
it's not our war.
the jews have been having the worst of it. they need allies.
- yeah, but we don't. -we need a foothold at the southern end of the grand union.
the jews control camden town.
your mother said,
"it's his cleverness that'll kill him."
no-one gets killed, polly.
we go down tomorrow when it's quiet and we leave our message.
if alfie solomon and his camden boys come to us, we'll negotiate the use of a secure bonded warehouse and then our legal activities in london can begin.
now please, open the fucking safe.
do you know, it was a fine speech you made in there, about this company believing in equal rights for women.
but when it comes to it, you don't listen to a word we say.
maybe you don't trust us.
she was one woman, thomas.
well, maybe it's time you forgot about her.
forgot about who?
you and the boys, go and get yourselves killed.
are you going to london now?
no, there's something i have to do first.
oh, i've got a typewriter like that.
i got it out of a catalogue.
i'm doing a correspondence course.
i'm learning to do it with my eyes shut.
it's a test you have to do.
will you come back before you go?
no.
i wish, just once, you wouldn't pay me, as if we were ordinary people.
yeah.
let's begin.
hands on the table.
tonight we have two new pilgrims joining us.
so, let's welcome them.
starting with you.
who is it that you're seeking to reach?
my husband.
he was taken six months ago by the influenza.
i tried to reach him through mrs breach at sparkhill but she kept getting his middle name wrong.
don't talk about mrs breach in this house.
she's an unsanctified charlatan.
and you?
who do you seek?
well, truth...
sorry, truth is, i'm not even sure she's dead.
so i came here to find out.
er...
you see, my son and my daughter were taken from me when they were very small.
taken by the parish authorities and i never knew what happened to them.
but lately...
i've had a feeling.
like, a feeling...
i can't put it into words.
and i keep having a dream.
i see a pretty girl, about 18-yea rs-old.
she's standing across the street and she tells me she's passed over.
now, my daughter would have been 18 this year.
on may 15th.
and this girl has dark eyes like mine.
and she shouts and shouts.
and she tells me she wants to talk to me because i'm her mother.
now, i don't even know what name they gave her after they stole her from me.
but if she does want to say goodbye,
i thought this would be the place.
you're wearing the black madonna.
you're gypsy?
the part of me that dreams is gypsy.
my maiden name is shelby.
so, perhaps you could do me first.
no!
no!
no!
no...
eamonn duggan?
all right, tommy's here.
hang on!
john!
i'm coming!
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,
10 if i'm still sober.
i got it from the doctor.
keeps me nice and calm.
same thing they gave us in the trenches to stop us fucking wanking.
polly said it's good for me temper.
- it slows me down, tom. -arthur, there are some things polly doesn't understand.
- i need you fast. not slow, eh?
she wouldn't let go of my fucking leg.
i bet that's not all she wouldn't let go of.
right. you know she's against this, tom. she's got opinions.
nothing wrong with opinions, john. come on.
- get in the fucking car! -shut up.
right!
the peaky blinders are going on fucking holiday!
sit down, you mad bastard.
you're against this the same as me, aren't you?
look out for anyone putting big money on divine star in the 3:30 at newmarket.
she's one of ours.
anything over a pound, tell me.
polly,
i don't wish to pry into your business, but you should know something.
that woman is a trickster.
what woman?
her sister was in the washhouse early, boasting there'd been a shelby at the table.
what woman?
gypsies talk to each other.
what woman?
you went to see mrs price in the patch last night.
i'm sorry...
so what do you know?
i know they push the glass.
the man, it's her cousin. he pushes the glass.
it's a trick.
they tell you what you already believe.
she set up after the war because of all the widows.
polly, i just thought you should know.
and in this fucking washhouse, did they tell you why i went there?
you tell a soul in this family, and i swear i will cut you.
i don't need a knife to stop me telling secrets given in confidence.
it is a matter of honour.
look at this! look.
- i love it.
your esme was right about one thing, you can't beat the countryside.
you know, i think i want to live in the country one day and keep chickens.
yeah, we'll see you in london, arthur.
- oh, for fuck's sake! -take this.
we need to bury him.
who the fuck is that?
it's irish business.
i thought it best if i deal with it on my own.
come on, we did a thousand of these in france.
john, grab his head.
so, we're not really going to london?
once we bury him, then the holiday begins.
much obliged.
it's a fucking freak show.
what the fuck is that racket?
this is what they call music these days, brother.
music? oi!
oi! put it away.
fuck off!
fucking look at this spot, eh?
it's all right, isn't it?
irish whiskey, a bottle.
and hurry up!
fucking hell,
i recognise a few of these lads.
that's sabini's cousin, over there.
that's right, arthur, it's sabini's club.
jesus christ, everybody in here's a fucking face.
just the lieutenants, john. no sign of the officers.
right, let's line them up.
holiday!
gentlemen, there's been a mistake.
i'm afraid you're going to have to leave.
we just bought a fucking bottle.
some of the men here recognise you from the racetracks in the north.
yeah, we get that a lot.
they say you have no business coming south of the line without prior agreement.
and what line would that be, my friend?
they say this is provocation.
right, well, you tell them we're on holiday.
you're breaking the rules.
they say you are the peaky blinders...
peaky scum!
who the fuck's next?
come here!
put some ice on 'em!
get out.
yeah?
yeah?
are you going to use that?
didn't think so.
we came here not to make enemies.
no.
we came here to make new friends!
those of you who are last will soon be first.
and those of you who are downtrodden will rise up.
yup.
you know where to find us.
i think i've lost a tooth.
i'll have none left at this rate!
some fucking holiday this is.
yeah? you all right without your fucking medicine, arthur?
- here, this'll fix you. -give me that!
- you, john boy, eh? how are you?
- or should i ask your fucking wife? -oh, give over!
no more talk of chickens, do you hear me?
--fuck the chickens.
i've 50 quid in me pocket.
let's paint the town, eh?
- come.
- oh, dear god! -good lord, i assumed it was betty with tea.
forgive me, sir, but your secretary was not at the desk.
no, because she takes lunch, like normal people.
and you can turn around, this lady is a professional life model.
she does this for a living.
i... i'm more than happy to come back later, sir.
no, no, no. later on i'm in the house. just, erm, keep your back turned, if you must.
yes, sir.
i would guess you haven't been exposed to bohemian society, major?
well, i... i... i play cards on occasion.
you're a stranger to cocaine and exotic dancing, too, i would imagine.
i find the more obvious vices the easiest to resist.
it's the sneaky little obscure ones that bring you to your knees, yes?
so what business is so urgent it trumps lunch?
well, sir, our man in birmingham has passed his first test with flying colours.
oh, i'm horrible at faces.
so i think we can begin to prepare him for...
the bigger task.
expressions elude me, i think too much.
sir?
i need your authority to proceed with all urgency in preparing the new man for the bigger task.
you're talking about your bookmaker.
yes, sir.
you have a history with this man. why did you choose him?
well, to apply pressure on a man for this type of work you have to know his weaknesses and i know this man's weaknesses intimately.
and after "mission accomplished", do we trust him to keep his mouth shut?
absolutely not, sir.
so when he's served his purpose, he will be consigned to history in exactly the same way as his predecessor.
you mean at the end of a rope?
well, the end of the rope has been this man's destiny since the night he was born.
you're early.
shut your eyes, lizzie.
what?
shut your eyes. go on, shut your eyes.
good. now, come with me.
no, shut your eyes!
--this way.
what are you doing, tom?
you've got to sit down here. right.
--sit down. now, okay...
- type this. -why?
lizzie, type this.
"if wi..." put your cigarette out.
right. "if winter comes...
--"...then can spring be far behind?"
why? did you say spring?
lizzie, what comes after winter?
let's see.
that's a question. where's the question mark?
put in the question mark.
now type this.
"wanted, secretary for expanding business."
slow down!
"must be able to take dictation and touch type.
"five days a week.
"uh, eight pounds and four shillings a month.
"must be able to start immediately."
are you serious?
things are starting to happen, lizzie.
i need someone who can look the other way sometimes.
and you can stop the other work too, lizzie.
all of it this time.
no exceptions.
eight o'clock, monday morning, the upstairs office.
don't be late.
newmarket was profitable.
arthur told me how you left your message.
and when i asked him where his medicine was, he said you poured it away.
all i poured away was opium and bromide.
oh, that's how it works in london, isn't it?
every boss has to have a mad dog at his side.
yeah, somebody who can't be predicted, somebody mad in the head.
but thomas shelby uses his own brother.
- stop fucking fighting me! -somebody has to.
that arrived an hour ago.
there's no name on it but it comes from camden town.
i was going to burn it.
i should have.
well done, tommy, you've picked a side.
now you're at war with sabini.
ada, are you coming for a drink?
no, the woman upstairs is looking after karl.
she goes mad if i'm late!
- ada shelby? -no.
your brother broke the rules.
i don't have a fucking brother.
me and my friends here need a bit of female company.
- let's go for a drive. -no!
- hold her steady, boys. -don't! get off!
- fucking hold him!
tommy shelby, i missed you at my club.
i was at the races.
sabini.
don't say my name.
jesus!
franco, take my name out of his mouth.
while you're in there, do a bit of digging for gold.
pay for the petrol.
you see how much i know about you?
i even know what's in your fucking mouth.
look at me. look at me!
look at me.
you take up with the jews.
yeah, you think that's what london's all about.
you can just come down, pick a side.
you fucking clown!
now your life is over.
my face is the last thing you'll ever see on earth.
your mistake.
you remember that when you get to hell.
finish him off.
--you! get back here!
i suppose we should see if the bastard's still alive.
what happened to the pub is irish business?
you shut your gypsy mouth and listen to your instructions.
eamonn duggan?
my son and my daughter were taken from me when they were very small.
<i>we're planning an expansion.</i>
<i>i'm taking premises in london.</i>
the italian gangs and the jewish gangs have been at war in london.
the jews have been having the worst of it. they need allies.
<i>we take the opportunity to show our hand.</i>
that arrived an hour ago.
there's no name on it but it comes from camden town.
well done, tommy.
now you're at war with sabini.
- ada shelby? -no.
your brother broke the rules.
sabini.
my face is the last thing you'll ever see on earth.
see if the bastard's still alive.
no! no!
it's all right, miss shelby. we work with tommy.
we're peaky blinders.
my name is not shelby!
ready for a visitor, mr shelby?
no.
i'm here on the king's orders.
i'm afraid i must insist.
ah.
you paid extra for daylight.
the racketeering business must be booming.
are you not going to thank me for saving your life?
pass me cigarettes?
three nights ago, at the co-operative stables in montague street, there was a murder.
a man named duggan.
the oxfordshire constabulary found his body in a shallow grave.
i need to piss.
nurse?
i know it was you who carried out the murder of mr duggan.
oh, by the way.
grace, she went to new york.
a place called, er...
poughkeepsie.
she's married now.
to a banker. he's rich.
i'm sure she's very happy.
you have been under my microscope for some weeks now.
i have been observing every move you make.
and that is why i was on hand to save your life.
i imagine being shot by a woman hurts the same as being shot by a man.
just a bit more shameful.
you know, mr campbell, when i got shot they gave me a medal.
yeah.
no medal for you i bet.
mr shelby, our reunion...
...is part of a very carefully worked out plan, which has been in place for some time now.
every time you lean on that stick i bet you see her face.
and as a result of the information in my possession,
i can charge you with murder at any time and provide two impeccable crown witnesses whose testimony will lead you directly to the gallows.
you are on my hook, mr shelby.
and from this moment forward...
...you belong to me.
so, get well quickly.
i'll be in touch the moment i hear you can piss standing up.
then i will send you your instructions.
curly, you left the gate open?
no, i locked it. i pinched myself when i did it.
- get that stuff under cover. -yeah.
hey!
who goes there?
tommy?
curly, get that oil you put on the legs when they go lame.
are you fucking mad, doyle?
the yellow stuff. go on.
they said you'd be in for another three weeks.
i need to get on a boat to london.
tonight.
you discharged yourself?
i'm a fucking sitting duck in there, charlie.
sabini could send a man at any time.
i need to get some things done.
you're burning up.
here.
oh, tommy! that stuff's for rubbing into fucking horses.
ha! i am a horse.
if you were a horse, they'd shoot you with this many broken bones.
get the black powder, curly.
- go. -yeah.
the black powder.
you pay for a bloody hospital and you're using witchcraft?
i need to sleep in the open air and feel the boat under me, charlie.
oh, tommy.
you're just like your mother.
do you have a boat here?
only the <i>january.</i> she's heavy.
london will take four days.
that'll do. can you spare curly?
he'll be my doctor.
then god help you.
you have tobacco, curly?
and tea and whisky.
we'll have you running around like a colt.
ah, get him aboard. i'll fill her up.
if i sleep all the way, it's camden town we're heading for.
what business do you have in camden town, tommy?
tell polly she's in charge while i'm away.
if i don't come back, tell her she's in charge for good.
you hungry yet, tommy?
you know what, curly?
i think i am.
where are we?
uh, heathrow. one more day and we'll be there.
i'll put something in the pan.
can you steer?
give it a go.
you're almost there, too, tommy.
fucking hell, lads. calm down.
put him down, ollie.
put him down, mate. he's only little.
you on your own?
seems so.
well, you're a brave lad, ain't you?
you want to take a look at my bakery?
we bake all sorts here mate, yeah.
did you know we bake over 10,000 loaves a week?
can you believe it?
we bake the white bread, we bake the brown bread.
we bake all sorts.
would you like to try some?
bread?
yeah?
all right.
what would you like, brown or white?
try the brown.
brown, right.
not bad.
not bad, eh?
not bad?
it's fucking awful, that stuff.
the fucking brown stuff is horrible, it's for the workers.
yeah.
the white stuff, now that is for the bosses.
come look.
well, i've heard very bad, bad, bad things about you birmingham people.
you're gypsies, right?
so what, do you live in a fucking tent or a caravan?
i came here to discuss business...
...with you, mr solomons.
well, rum's for fun and fucking, innit?
so, whisky, now that...
that is for business.
let's talk first, eh?
suit yourself.
they say you had your life saved by a policeman.
i have policemen on my payroll.
well, i don't like policemen because policemen, they can't be trusted.
mr sabini uses policemen all the time.
that's why he's winning the war in london and you are losing it.
a war ain't over until it's over, mate.
you were in the war?
i once carried out my own personal form of stigmata on an italian.
i pushed his face up against the trench and shoved a six-inch nail up his fucking nose and i hammered it home with a duck board.
it was fucking biblical, mate.
so don't come in here and sit there in my chair and tell me that i'm losing my war to a fucking wop.
that war was a long time ago.
you need to be more realistic.
realistic, yeah?
realistic?
well, if you weren't losing the war, then you wouldn't have sent me the telegram.
really?
you forget your fucking telegram. the telegram just said, "hello."
very simple, you want to sell me something.
what?
- we join forces. -fuck off.
no! categorical.
fucking ridiculous.
mr solomons.
your distillery provides one-tenth of your income.
protection is another 10%.
and the rest you make from the race tracks.
i know you keep a gun in the drawer.
i know you keep it beside the whisky.
i know you offer a deal or death.
i know what i'm saying makes you angry.
but i am offering you a solution.
you see, mr sabini is running all your bookies off your courses.
and he is closing down the premises that take your rum.
and people don't trust your protection any more.
you're the bloke who shot billy kimber, right?
you did, you fucking shot him. that's you.
you fucking betrayed him, mate.
so it'd be entirely appropriate to do what i am thinking in my head to you right now.
i can offer you 100 good men.
all with weapons.
and a new relationship with the police.
intelligence.
intelligence is a very valuable thing, innit, my friend?
and usually it comes far too fucking late.
let's say that i shot you already, right, in the fucking face.
and the bullet goes bone, mush, bone, cabinet over there.
which is a shame, innit,
'cause that cabinet's fucked now and i got to get shot of it.
- so, what i'd do is this...
it's fucking simple, mate.
i cut that cabinet in half, don't i?
i do. i just literally... i cut the cabinet... i cut...
i cut the cabinet literally in half, mate.
and i take one half of the cabinet, all right, and i put it into a barrel and i take the other half of the cabinet and all its pieces and i put that into another barrel, right?
and i send this barrel off to mandalay.
and the other barrel off to somewhere like...
i don't know...
timbuktu.
- you ever been? -no.
no?
would you like to go?
no.
you know, i always thought that you'd have a great big fucking gold ring in your nose.
i'm sorry, go on.
tell us your plan.
ada.
how the fuck did you find me?
what, are you reading polly's letters?
polly showed me the letter.
look, you think you're safe because you moved flat, but you're not.
polly thinks the same.
when will you understand? i just want you all out of my life.
ada.
look at us, eh?
and it'll happen again.
yeah, well, next time i'll be ready.
in fact, i want them to try again 'cause i'll shoot their balls off!
- ada, put the fucking gun away. -get away from me, i'm late for work.
all right, fine. fine.
just take this.
take it.
where you're living now is right on the edge of sabini's territory and all the coppers round there work for him.
i've got a lot of money coming in that i can't put through the banks.
my accountant says the best thing is to buy property for cash and put it in the name of a family member.
a house? a whole house?
it's all yours.
four storeys, eight bedrooms, kitchen, scullery.
rooms for a maid, if your political conscience will allow.
at least go and have a look, eh?
shoot the fucking lot of them.
mr sabini? the police are here.
tell them to wipe their feet.
so why do i have to tell you everything?
we can't search every train that comes into london.
they don't use trains, they use boats.
the boatmen are all gypsies. he's a fucking gypsy.
why do we have to tell them everything?
okay, we can't search every boat.
lucky for me, i have a boy in the jews' rum house.
the gypsy went to meet solomons.
and after, they drank whisky and shook hands.
and then alfie gave him some salt or some such kike thing that means peace.
what exactly d'you want us to do, mr sabini?
did you bring dog shit in here on your shoes?
check, have a look.
i can smell something.
you've got photographs of this tommy shelby, though, right?
we have military id photographs from his time with the warwickshire yeomanry.
shelby won medals.
okay, so you've got his fucking photo.
if he shows his face in camden town, your coppers lift him. all right?
you know...
sometimes when i smell something, it's something that's not real, it's something more like a... like a premonition.
it's like sometimes i smell something, but it's not a smell, it's just...
...something isn't right.
mr sabini, we'll do everything we can to deal with this man.
deal?
did you say, "do a deal"?
i didn't mean that.
fuck.
fuck.
- you've been fucking got at. -no, you're being ridiculous.
somebody's fucking sat you down.
somebody's fucking sat you down and talked to you!
- mr sabini... -we should go.
this fucking gypsy has sat down with the fucking coppers!
mr sabini. and you're taking with both fucking hands off of me and off of him!
okay, so now you fucking follow shelby.
you fucking follow him and you finish him!
oh, shit.
i told youse, boys, 'ere she is.
what the bloody hell is going on?
when did you get back?
i didn't want to miss your birthday, pol.
back to work.
how d'you know it's my birthday? nobody ever knows.
ah, it's different this year.
john, finn, bring the car round.
where are we going?
to unwrap your birthday present.
after you.
good morning!
you said you were gonna buy ada a house.
yep, that's right, i did.
just had a bit of cash left over.
this is ours?
no, polly...
this is yours.
'cause you deserve it.
what would i do with all these rooms?
well, you could, uh, relax for one.
come here at weekends.
it has a garden, eh?
you love gardens.
you can grow roses, pol.
i don't know, have a piano.
have people round, they can have a singsong, eh?
god help the bloody neighbours.
fuck the neighbours.
welcome home, pol.
arthur, why don't you take the boys outside, wait by the car?
pol...
i know you haven't been happy for a while.
and i know why.
esme is all right, you know?
she's got a good heart, she has.
i've spoken to her and she told me.
told you what?
she told me what it is that would make you happy.
i've spoken to our contacts in the police.
they have contacts in the council, and they have contacts with the people who keep the parish records.
records of adoptions, and of confidential forced removals.
now, with your permission,
i'd like to grease a few palms and take a look at the records they never showed you.
pol...
i am going to find your son and daughter and i'm gonna bring them home.
that's what this house is for.
so that you can bring your family home where they belong.
we're moving up, pol.
go have a look what you think.
can you hear that?
silence at last.
- and it belongs to us.
mummy, there's loads of chairs!
what's in there?
still here?
well, there's a lot coming in and a lot going out.
well, as long as there's more coming in, we're all right.
this came for you today.
it's all the way from america, new york.
somewhere called poughkeepsie?
and the decorators doing the garrison want paying.
arthur forgot and pulled a gun when they asked, so...
- they've stopped and everything's green. -all right, well, just pay it.
oh, and we need to put an advert in the <i>mail,</i>
grand reopening."
oh, and you said there's a letter that had to go today.
special delivery.
i wrote it in the diary.
yes, i haven't written it out yet.
well, you can just tell me and i'll write it down.
i've learnt shorthand.
fair enough.
dear mr churchill...
has your pencil broken?
no. no, do go on.
dear mr churchill...
i've been approached by an agent of the crown to carry out a task, as yet unspecified.
<i>"his name is major campbell and i believe he reports to you.</i>
<i>"therefore, i decided to make direct contact with you</i>
<i>"to make sure that certain things are clearly understood."</i>
<i>"mr churchill, you should know that i am a former british soldier</i>
<i>"and if you look at my war record,</i>
<i>"you will see that i fought bravely at verdun and at the somme.</i>
"also, you will see that my actions at mons
"saved thousands of allied lives.
"i know that you resigned your ministerial position
"and the safety of an office
"to go and fight on the front line with the men.
"i read that you fought bravely, mr churchill.
"therefore, i hope i will be treated
"in any dealings we have with a degree of respect,
"soldier to soldier.
"my demands are slight and my sacrifice in service of my country
"will no doubt once again be great.
"yours sincerely, thomas shelby."
military medal and the dcm.
distinguished conduct medal.
hands up in this room, those who were at the somme.
those who were at the battle of verdun?
thomas shelby was a tunneller.
his demand is rather amusing.
he has asked that the colonial office grant him an empire export licence.
and specifically a licence covering india,
malay peninsula, canada and russia.
he plans to transport certain manufactured goods from birmingham to the poplar docks.
and you plan to agree to this demand?
dear god, major campbell...
we will be asking this man to carry out an assassination on behalf of the crown, once more risking his life.
these demands by comparison are slight and easily met with a few quiet words over lunch with the appropriate ministers.
sir, with the greatest respect,
thomas shelby is a murdering, cut-throat, mongrel, gangster.
and yet, the tunnels were dug beneath our feet to silence the guns pointed at our heads.
get thomas shelby's details from campbell and get some kind of royal appointment stamp.
temporary.
temporary?
just until the deed is done.
agreed, major campbell?
and then i can proceed as discussed?
ag reed, sir.
come on, let's go inside.
here, pass the ball!
come on.
come on in, boys.
did you have a good game?
i'm starving, have you done anything for lunch?
it'll be on in a minute, in you go.
go in and wash your hands, boys, all right?
come on, mister.
mrs johnson?
yes. who are you?
i'm from birmingham council, bordesley parish.
no-one wrote to me. what d'you want?
i would like to talk about your son, about henry.
can i come in?
oh, i'd rather you didn't, he doesn't like to talk about this.
i see.
so what does henry know about his real identity, mrs johnson?
i only deal with mr ross from the agency and he only ever writes, so...
why are you here in person?
well, the boy is approaching his 18th birthday.
this isn't right!
you're not from the council, something isn't right.
hmm. what does he know, mrs johnson?
he knows his mother couldn't cope.
she drank too much, she used opium.
she used to beat him.
but that isn't the truth, is it?
look, i think you should come back when my husband's here.
does he know what his real name is?
his real name is johnson, henry johnson, now i would like you to go away and come back when my husband's here.
the truth is, he was taken from his mother without her permission.
henry, go back inside, please.
who are you?
please, henry, go on!
- your real name is michael gray. -no!
your real mother wants to see you.
her address is on the back of this card.
she just wants to talk.
- go away. -she just wants to talk.
go away and leave us alone.
go away!
come on, let's go back inside.
come on, i'll get you something to eat.
come on, henry.
come on. come on.
call yourself a shelby?
fucking hit him, finn.
hit him, that's right.
all right, isiah, your turn.
finn! call yourself a shelby? fucking hit him, for fuck's sake!
hit him.
get him out of there, get him back!
- get him back! -arthur, for fuck's sake!
get him out of there!
rockfair is down to sixes.
right, what happened?
it was a fair fight.
yeah.
arthur just caught him with a good 'un.
i saw the body, don't fucking lie to me.
i saw the body, what fucking happened?
i'm not family, i'm saying nothing.
arthur...
he's blown a few times lately.
six, seven.
it's like he's not there in the head.
he can't even hear "stop".
even his own name.
and then he cries.
right, listen to me.
that's two fucking stories.
your brother killed a boy.
there were witnesses, there will be questions, get your story straight, it was an accident.
fuck off.
i spoke to the doctor, he said the kid probably had a weak heart.
we'll look after his mother.
it'll be fine.
polly said i should have stuck with the medicine.
i said that you know best.
it's like a fucking boat, tommy.
full of heavy cargo, like coal or iron.
sometimes it slips to one end.
and the boat tips.
i can feel it slipping.
and i can feel the boat tipping.
but there ain't nothing i can do about it.
it's like me fuckin' headâ€™s just like this fuckin' black fucking barge!
and it just fucking drifts in and out, in and out.
well, we're home a long time now, arthur.
we're home a long time.
- i thought you were all right. -yeah, well...
i, i, i don't think i am, tommy.
take this fucking thing away from me.
just fuck off, arthur.
you know what?
i've had enough.
i've fucking had enough.
just fuck off!
what?
i'm supposed to treat you like a fucking kid again, eh?
keep you away from guns and fucking rope, is that it?
you think i haven't got enough on!
- stop it, tommy. -arthur?
you think i haven't got enough on?
- stop it. -the war is done!
- shut the door on it! -stop it.
shut the door on it like i did, eh?
- can you do that? -yeah?
- like i fucking did. -i'm not fucking you.
- shut the fucking door, eh? -but i'm not fucking you!
i am not fucking you!
everyone fucking knows it!
god!
look at yourself. eh?
look at yourself.
take a long, hard, fucking look at yourself.
time for lunch, sir.
i thought we could eat at the desk, like the old days.
you remembered.
tongue and pickle, sir.
but it's the single stroke of mustard, that's the thing.
- hmm. -the fine detail.
speaking of detail...
how much is thomas shelby paying you in bribes per week?
hmm?
actually, i already know.
two pounds a week, eight pounds a month, plus extras for specific favours.
when i left, you were an honest man.
and now you're on the peaky blinders' payroll.
shelby is a worm and feeds off the rotten parts of your mind.
he gets in through your ear, with a whisper.
he crawls in over your tongue as you lie to the judge and the pastor.
mr moss...
we are entering a bloody phase of a bloody war with no quarter asked or given.
but as of this moment, you are now back on the side of the angels.
shelby thinks you work for him, but in truth, you work for me.
and i will use you mercilessly.
polly, these are the files for michael and anna gray.
as you can see, one is white...
...and one is black.
what you saw in your dreams...
...was right.
your daughter is dead.
um... you do it, i can't read it.
after anna was taken from you, she was put with a...
with a family of a railway station master in stafford.
she never settled.
so she kept running away.
she got on a train to birmingham once...
eventually they sent her to australia where she died of something called spring fever.
so my little anna travelled all the way back across the world to be with me in my dreams?
she came all by herself.
well...
that's one train they couldn't get her off.
but, pol, michael is alive.
he's in england...
...and i know where he lives, i went there.
- but, pol... -and?
okay, polly, listen to me.
just listen to me, please.
pol!
the woman that he calls "mother" will never let him come here.
just tell me where he is, tommy.
polly, if you go there and you get mad and she gets mad and she calls the police, they will never let you anywhere near him and the boy will get scared.
that's what will happen, pol.
polly.
polly...
you just tell me where he is, thomas.
tell me where he is, thomas!
polly...
pulling the gun...
pulling the gun is why i can't tell you.
pol, i'm sorry, you're going to have to wait till he's 18.
till he's old enough to make his own decision.
wait!
you tell me where he is!
if you shoot me, you'll never know.
mickey! hurry up, the party's starting.
good, carry on.
finn, where you going?
- to talk to arthur. -right.
arthur?
go away.
what's wrong? why aren't you ready?
for what?
the garrison.
the reopening of your pub. it's tonight.
tommy don't want me there.
it was tommy who told me to get you.
he says it's your name above that door, so you've got to be there.
no... no, look at me.
i'm staying away.
go away.
get out.
i told you to go away.
sometimes, when we boys are feeling blue, this is what we do.
it's called tokyo.
it's good stuff, arthur.
it'll help you.
for special occasions.
oh, boys!
my fucking garrison!
take that. take that an' all.
'ere you are, lizzie. let me get you a light.
there you go, my darling.
jeremiah, i'll be with you in a second.
oh!
look at the place!
you all right?
busier we are, the faster time passes.
yeah?
arthur. tokyo, it's fuel for races, eh?
but you've seen a doped horse after a race...
oh, yeah.
grand openings and race days only, brother.
- all right? -go on then, tommy!
- there you go, come on, drink up. -boys.
- all right, mick? -tom.
finn! gimme that.
keep him off the whisky, john.
pol.
ada! i didn't know you were coming.
- there's aunt polly. -aw.
hi!
hey, who's that?
d'you want a cuddle?
polly, that's right. take him. polly...
oh, ada, why don't you think about coming home?
hello, ada.
say you'd...
- tommy...
so what do you think, eh?
it's very...
- gold? -yeah.
hello, ada.
hello, trouble, how're you doing?
- mmm. -oh, you're spilling my drink!
hey, arthur, look who it is.
so what d'you want me to say to her?
just talk to her.
no one can get through to her.
tell her i had no choice.
i appreciate this.
- hello, brother. -ada, come here, you!
you big bear!
polly? why don't you come and join us?
- what? -i'm not an idiot.
he asked you to come, didn't he?
i don't want conversation, i want an address.
until i have that, i've not got anything to say.
now, it's a party!
yeah, it is! oh!
and i'm going to enjoy myself.
no, pol, don't be silly.
excuse me?
would you care to dance?
it'd be my pleasure.
my love, pleasure hasn't even begun.
excuse me?
i'm looking for someone called elizabeth gray.
i was told she lived here at number 17.
i came last night but there was nobody here.
so i waited.
what do you want with elizabeth gray?
i think she might be my mother.
the italian gangs and the jewish gangs have been at war in london.
<i>the jews have been having the worst of it. they need allies.</i>
tell us your plan.
i can offer you 100 good men.
get him out of there, get him back!
arthur killed a boy.
polly, these are the files for michael and anna gray.
your daughter is dead.
but, pol, michael is alive.
i'm looking for someone called elizabeth gray.
what do you want with elizabeth gray?
i think she might be my mother.
<i>there's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.</i>
he's head of some secret department, the irish desk.
he was murdered this morning in a street show in the patch.
he was irish. is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
do you read the papers?
birmingham papers.
i recommend the <i>daily mail.</i>
it will broaden your mind.
now, if you read the national press, you would know that the king has offered the rebel irish a treaty.
now, some of the fenians want to accept it.
the ira do not.
now, the ira have a long and glorious relationship with the garrotte.
oh, dear.
are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
- that will be all. -right, sir.
oh, moss, i'm going to be up and down from london quite a bit.
i'm going to need some lodgings. can you help me with that?
well, you wouldn't want to stay in the lodgings you had last time then, sir, eh?
too many bad memories, i suppose.
you should understand, moss,
i have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
no, sir?
i imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
a laugh, sir?
you think it's funny that i developed feelings?
no idea what you're talking about, sir.
i have no regrets about what happened with miss burgess.
no "bad memories".
right, sir.
he's losing his bloody mind.
next.
next.
all right, then.
name?
the digbeth kid.
the dig...
what are you? a boxer?
digbeth kid like billy the kid.
spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
cowboy pictures? tom mix?
yeah?
what are you...
wait, wait. it's not a real gun.
- let's have a look then, eh? -it's made of wood.
bang.bang.
very nice.
where did you get the gun belt?
my sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
my mum did most of the stitching.
she's not my real mum, but...
she does what mothers do.
so she made you a gun belt.
all right then, mother's boy.
there's the door. on you go. we're looking for...
have you ever been arrested?
- yeah.
- yeah?
- no. -good.
you're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
arthur, we can stand him up.
do you know what that means?
the new home secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
damn right.
about bloody time.
so we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
first offence, you'll get a week inside.
we'll give you five quid for your trouble.
how does that sound, cowboy?
yeah.
good. write your address down for finn on your way out.
i can't write.
that's all right, finn can't read.
don't worry.
just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
if the sheriff don't run you out of town first.
good man.
- oh, i don't know, tom. kids these days. -hmm.
they didn't fight.
so they're different.
they stay kids.
how was it?
i was starving, so i would have eaten anything.
but really it was super.
super.
so, uh, are you a cook?
not a cook. no.
the man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car. he looks rich.
what does he do?
- he works with horses. -really?
i love horses.
- i've got a bay mare. -no!
i ride it all the time.
then it's in the blood.
i've got about a million questions.
so do i.
i've had different pictures in my head.
well, here i am.
it's all right that it's me, isn't it?
i don't have any choice.
i mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
we don't choose.
and that's it.
yeah, that's right.
god gave you to me.
people took you away.
and it is all right that it's me, isn't it?
in a place like this.
i thought it would be worse.
run for the hills! it's the digbeth kid!
get out of town, kid, or i will shoot your fucking head off!
time's up!
- you're dead, go down.
- john!
all right then, polly.
who's this?
gentlemen, this is your cousin.
polly's son, michael.
pleased to meet you.
john.
i'm arthur. you've already met me.
i used to throw you out of the window, so john could catch you.
i used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down watery lane.
i bet you're glad to be back.
i don't remember any of it.
all i remember is the day they took me away.
well, you're here now, son.
welcome to the shelby family.
later on, we'll show you the ropes.
hmm. yeah, we'll show you what's what.
let's leave him be for now, eh?
come on, boys.
- nice suit.
they seem nice.
here he is, mr inconspicuous.
corporal billy kitchen. bloody grand to see you.
how are you feeling?
i've just come out of bandages myself.
ready for active service.
thanks for seeing me here, tommy.
it's all right, bill.
you don't have to stand in line for us.
it's men like you we're looking for, billy.
but you have to pass the medical first.
sheffield mob showed up at wincanton trotting track.
i took a bullet.
when do the bandages come off?
when i take 'em off.
one week. not before.
you'll smell no rot.
there's no gangrene.
it's been a long time. eh, billy?
what did you do with your medals?
threw them in the cut. same as you.
it was never a hardship having you black country boys on our left flank.
and you brummies did all right on our right.
damn right.
i want you to be the head of a brigade, bill.
it'll be brigadier kitchen from now on.
you'll have 100 men under your command.
and now we've got a member of the kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the black country without being held up and robbed.
i don't know what you're talking about.
go home, bill.
round up any good men you can trust and put the word out.
black country boys and brummie boys are on the same side again.
that'll be the bloody day.
well, this is the bloody day.
london, man. there for the taking.
tommy, i need to use the telephone.
polly said you had one in the pub.
all right, be quick. i have business.
sir.
polly said you own this place.
she said you own lots of different businesses.
you call her polly or mum?
i can't get used to calling her mum yet.
who are you calling?
my mother. i mean...
i know what you mean.
and what are you going to tell her?
i'm going to tell her where i am.
and now you're going to tell her you're going home.
polly said i could stay for a few days.
- you want to stay?
- i've only just arrived.
what age are you michael?
seventeen.
seventeen. which means it's not up to you, right?
i'm 18 in a few weeks. i make up my own mind.
you smoke?
no.
drink?
you're going to call your mother, going to tell her you're getting the next train home.
and when you get there, you're going to write a letter to polly saying when you're 18, you'll come back here and sort things out.
i just told you.
i make up my own mind.
do you know what we do, michael?
we, shelbys.
yes. i think i know what you do.
yeah.
you've got smart eyes.
but you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
it's not all right.
people get hurt.
now, call your mother and i will drive you to the station.
no.
in my village, there's this little wishing well.
it's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
everybody says how pretty it is.
but i swear to god, if i spend another day in that village,
i'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
probably blow my hands off with it, but it'd be worth it.
just to see all those pretty white bricks spread over the pretty village green.
hmm.
yep. you're polly's son, all right.
all right boys, let's go to work.
let's be having it!
don't wait!
keep it moving.
move!
next lad!
name?
abbey heath.
abbey heath. profession?
baker.
good lad. fill it out and fuck off.
next lad!
name?
buddy halls.
buddy halls. right. profession?
baker.
good lad. fill it out and fuck off.
next lad!
- name? -billy kitchen.
billy kitchen. occupation?
head baker.
fill it out.
um, tommy shelby, mate.
never give power to the big man, what did i tell you?
hmm?
never give power to the big man.
next lad!
name?
all right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the aerated bread company of camden town.
if anyone asks, that's what you do.
you're bakers.
the coppers in camden town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
tell them you've come down from north to find work, to break strikes.
tell them you're fascists, if you have to.
we're finding lodgings for you, but for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.
but don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
any questions?
yes?
i haven't even seen any bread.
he'll wake up.
granted, he won't have any teeth left, but he will be a wiser man for it.
and the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke. won't he?
right!
there are fucking rules here.
yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
quite simply, they have to be obeyed. all right?
rule number one.
the distinction between bread and rum, yeah, is not discussed.
rule number two.
anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
not discussed!
rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, i don't care.
for the rest of your fucking miserable measly lives, yeah?
because i, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
jewish women.
you do not go anywhere near them because jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
i think that's fair.
hmm.
hmm.
all right, that's it, yeah.
forgive me, i interrupted you.
pick him up.
get them out of here and make this fucking work.
don't fucking wait!
you're meant to be fucking soldiers!
you're a fucking disgrace!
go!
you've got a key?
i kept a spare.
give it to me.
could do with some paint, eh?
yeah, when i decide.
what is it that you want, tommy?
just came by to say hello.
tommy shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
fine.
i've got 800 pounds left in the shelby property fund, and i need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
to rent?
yes.
to poor people.
ten to a room.
no repairs, no water.
and if they complain, you just send arthur and the boys round.
you know, i give advice down at the library.
families thrown on the street.
it's men like you we're fighting.
well, anyway, i was just passing. thanks for the tea.
tommy.
there are always men outside watching the house.
yeah. gangsters of the worst kind.
but they're there to keep you safe.
no there are others. they look like coppers.
well, they're on your side as well.
i don't have a fucking side.
ada, yes, you do.
and, anyway, if i thought there was no-one watching the house,
i couldn't sleep.
cheerio then.
that was great. well done.
out we get then.
this house is mine.
i've taken on a maid.
she's made up the big room for you.
come on, let's have a look.
i thought we could spend the week here.
you know, get to know each other again.
i've got ham. do you like ham?
i like ham, yes.
- i've got a maid... -yes, you said.
she's upstairs.
she can give us some tea.
look, i ring this bell. watch.
yes, madam?
i think we'd like some tea.
you get used to it.
the cleaning job's gone. vacancy's filled.
i'm not a cleaner.
but i have come to clean away some dirt.
why don't you put that away before it goes off?
you killed my son!
you peaky bastard!
you beat him and beat him and beat him.
your son was a boxer.
no!
he was a boy who got into a ring with an animal.
yeah, ain't that the truth.
i've come to stop you because the coppers and nobody else will.
if you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
that's where the trouble is.
gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
i've seen 'em.
walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
hold that gun up and do it!
fucking do it!
do it!
i'm going to finish my drink.
you can finish it with me, if you like.
now, look. look at me.
we've got a fund.
for you. you'll get paid weekly.
i know it won't bring back your son.
i know that.
you have other sons.
you do.
and we'll find them work.
and you won't have to work.
- you'll be...
somebody has got to stop you people.
who broke the fucking mirror?
seven years' bad luck, that is.
there'll be another four boatloads tomorrow.
what's up, charlie? business is good.
this isn't business, this is bloody work.
cigarettes and booze is all right, but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
i'm not even sure it's stolen.
some of it is legally purchased.
one day, all of it will be.
it's like having a fucking job.
hey! easy with them fan belts.
i'll wipe that smile off your face. i want another pound a boat.
done.
you don't even fight me any more.
and it's no sport getting through the black country with this truce.
they just fucking wave at you from the bank.
well, just wave back, eh?
and all these fucking cars.
when did you last ride a horse, tom?
--uh.
these are just dry, mr campbell.
major campbell.
beg pardon?
it doesn't matter.
are there any other irishmen lodging in this house?
no, mr campbell, i keep a respectable house.
with your special exception, i have no irish here.
well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
you're not expecting trouble, i hope.
they only said you was a policeman of some sort.
no. i'm not expecting any trouble.
is there a cafe nearby that serves chops? lamb or pork?
there is a chophouse two streets away.
but i myself serve sandwiches.
egg and cress, or ham.
or anything that pleases you.
no. no. no.
i, i think i'll go out and get some air.
our scheduled meeting is not until sunday.
i decided to bring it forward.
you just wanted to show me that you know where i live, isn't that it?
am i supposed to be impressed?
you know, mr churchill was impressed.
yes, he was.
all my demands have been met.
did he tell you?
yes.
yes. we had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
as a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
- the gentlemen all found it quite funny.
i see, the gentlemen found it funny.
tell me this, mr campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
we will discuss our business on sunday, on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place that has already been determined.
you have made your point. good night, mr shelby.
there was another reason i came to see you tonight.
i just didn't want you to be made a fool of, is all.
the lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall i put this?
well, your landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in stechford.
she's only semi-retired.
i bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
see you sunday!
- name? -digbeth kid.
your real name.
harold hancox.
profession?
illegal bookmaker.
you don't admit that.
you say something like, "umbrella mender".
and then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
umbrella mender.
you were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
any explanation?
no.
no.
"no.
"i have no explanation
"for my possession of those items, officer."
take him down, will you? i'll fill in the rest myself.
come on, son.
bloody hellfire.
you've killed him, huh?
as i've explained, he's not easy to get at.
he's got an army round him.
but when the time is right...
the time is right. it's right now.
when he's away from his familiar territory, i will take him.
- so what do you want? -we heard from a guard at winson green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
kid called harold hancox.
we could make a point.
how many bakers is there in camden town now?
there are a lot of bakers in camden town, mr sabini, but, as i have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
who won the 4:15 at chepstow?
ragman.
- where's my dry cleaning? -it's been collected.
who won the 3:50 at kempton park?
- what? you don't know? -i can find out.
no need. i know already.
you see, the favourites, they're all winning.
and the second favourites are being done.
he's bewitching them.
bewitching?
gypsy stuff. herbs, potions.
and he's tipping off our big punters, so they know who's going to win.
regular customers betraying us for profit.
you'd think they'd be loyal to us. but profit, you see, comes before race, creed, family.
results look normal to me.
you see shit!
mr sabini, if you think they're planning to fix northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of towcester.
- i gave you a job already. -and the job will be done.
- but meantime... -meantime, fuck!
meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in birmingham?
why would you want me to say that out loud?
is there somebody listening?
all right, i'll say it.
we'll kill the hancox kid to send a message.
good, and then you deal with tommy fucking shelby.
you wanted to see me?
aye.
take off your clothes.
i know what you are.
so, take off your clothes.
not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if i may say.
indeed not.
so it's true. stop.
i only wanted proof. not satisfaction.
or indeed infection.
are you in on the joke?
what joke?
i have unfinished business in this filthy city.
and when the time comes, i will finish that business.
and then my wrath will come down on all of youse.
--but now, tell your friends in the police station that i know.
and when my judgement comes,
i'll be the one that's laughing.
get out.
on the right. on the right.
we haven't got all night. come on!
let's be having you, watkins, in there on the right.
on the right! come on, boys!
harold hancox?
tell everybody, this is what happens to blinders who come into the green from now on.
orders of sabini.
look, i'm not a blinder. i'm not a blinder. i've been stood up.
i'm not real! i'm not real!
i'm not real!
this had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
where's the boy?
in the back room.
i only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
- he wanted to come in and say hello... -shut up, john.
there is nothing of interest to michael in this room.
tommy, get on with it.
last night, one of our men had his throat cut in winson green.
this morning, i had a telegram saying it was sabini who ordered it.
and it says here that thomas shelby's next.
if our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
sabini knows that. so we need to get the green sorted out.
scudboat, you and one of the boys break a couple of windows, get yourselves arrested.
i'll have our coppers get you into the green and you can find the bastards who did it.
instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
what? everybody else is getting a bloody car.
- i'm still on a donkey.
all right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
and before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
he was just a kid.
we'll start a fund for his family, pol.
agreed.
so is that it? can i go now?
well, as company treasurer,
i need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
on what?
on a horse.
a thousand guineas on a horse?
that's right.
when was this decided?
you've been busy with michael.
oh, my god.
so, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
polly, there's a thoroughbred, quarter-arab filly up for auction at the doncaster bloodstock.
what do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
when we make our move on sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by sabini's police.
a good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
we'll be in there with all the toffs.
- coppers won't know where to look. -hmm.
yeah, the epsom derby, pol.
we'll be drinking with the bloody king.
the derby?
did he say the derby?
that's right.
for the last 10 years, sabini's made it his race.
if we're going to take him down, might as well make it there, as a symbol.
did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
pol.
a good racehorse is an investment, like property.
we need to diversify the portfolio.
so when is this sale?
tomorrow.
tommy's had a death threat, so we'll have to go with him for protection.
so, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole arab.
quarter-arab is better!
- quarter-arab, it means... -curly, shut up.
i thought i told you to lock that door.
he did. i used the key on the nail.
look, i've been listening.
- i want to go with them. -you see?
i love horses. i could even help.
over my dead body!
it'll be all right, mum.
i've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
they're very respectable. people bring their butlers.
yeah, and their posh wives!
and their mistresses.
let him come, polly.
we'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
i'll drop him back at the house in sutton before it gets dark.
no.
fucking no!
all right, that's it. back to work.
come on!
aunt pol, when i was michael's age,
i'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.
if you want to scare that kid away forever, carry on how you're going.
if you want him to stay, let him come.
i can't believe it.
all john's old things fit me.
christ, you look like your father.
shrimp, ham.
what was he like? my dad?
how did he die?
well, i won't lie to you.
he died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
a real river gypsy's death.
but he could sing, play the piano...
his smile would break your heart.
you've got his same beautiful eyes.
when he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
his trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
i have told them not to blow that horn.
this is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
- she's heating up, curly. take a look. -yeah.
let me out for a piss.
she made loads. do you want one?
what the bloody hell's that?
sandwiches. ham, i think. and we've got shrimp paste, too.
there's tea, but we'll have to take turns 'cause there's only one cup.
what?
sandwiches?
- yeah. -polly made bloody sandwiches?
what's this? teddy bear's fucking picnic?
all right. we will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on. all right?
no crumbs, charlie.
- hand them over.
- herd them up, arth, you fat bastard.
- fuck off.
- john, come on!
all right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
no weapons, no drinking. john, we will stay together.
when the horse comes up, i will do the bidding.
i've already registered my interest with the auctioneer.
so he knows to expect my bids.
do i get to run a hand over her, tommy?
we'll have a vet's report, curly. but keep an eye open when she walks.
i've got a feeling, tommy. something isn't right.
it's all right, curly. you're just in an unfamiliar place, we all are.
- i get feelings sometimes, tommy. -it's all right, curly. it's all right.
- shut up, curly.
- do i hear 1,450?
do i hear 500, 500,
1,600, 1,700? thank you.
why do people come late to these things?
hmm?
people come late 'cause they know what they want.
it's only you who needs to see every horse.
am i bid?
2,600. i am bid!
sold!
morals of marcus, sedgemere stud, by tetrarch out of lady josephine.
we'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
all right, tommy, this is her.
do i hear 800 guineas?
850. do i hear nine?
do i hear nine? nine, am i bid?
bid for this one.
the grey? why?
- he's beautiful. -it's a filly.
micky needs some pace on the gallops. i promised him.
1,000. do i hear 1,050?
do i hear 250?
i'll go halves with you from the spring fund. go, go.
do i hear five?
do i hear seven?
1,700. thank you.
that's it, tom, you have to stop.
you don't have it in your belt.
yes, i do. i'm having the horse.
she's a sweet beast, tom. but, stop, i tell you.
- i feel something bad! -shut up, curly!
2,000. do i hear 2,050?
2,050. am i bid?
-2,050... -enough!
billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000, i am bid. do i hear 2,050?
last time.
sold! to mr...
thomas shelby.
to the premises of mr charles strong,
small heath.
- what kind of premises? -boat yard.
yachts?
canals.
i'm curious. what is your business, mr shelby?
import, export.
but i also sell pegs and tell fortunes.
you beat us to it.
did i?
i was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
- sorry. -thomas shelby from where?
from birmingham.
goodness!
no, not much.
may carleton. i breed racehorses and train them.
what is it you do?
i rarely answer questions, is what i do.
tommy, come on, hurry up! we've got to go!
well, before you go, if you ever decide to put that filly out,
- i'd be interested in having her. -i plan to race her.
- do you have a trainer? -i know people.
- i know people, too. -tommy!
we've got to get this kid back before dark or polly will have your balls!
she will have 'em!
we know different people, i would guess.
my father knows mick hancock.
- trained three ascot winners. -oh, so that was your father?
yes.
we're joint-owners of the stud.
he took the majority share when my husband was killed.
ypres.
tommy! we've got to get back to the caravans!
the chickens are hungry!
so will you consider me?
i will consider you.
you still didn't tell me what you do.
oh! i do bad things.
but you already know that.
right, about bloody time!
it's the fucking truth, john boy.
rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
tommy, maybe she was the something bad i had the feeling about!
ah! she looks all right to me, curly!
all their men are dead, see. officers, all shot.
yeah, by us.
all i'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
here, michael, you drive.
thomas shelby?
- tommy!
- tommy! down!
tommy shelby?
how about fucking arthur?
fucking good to meet you.
get him off him!
arthur! arthur!
get him off him!
come on. stop it, arthur.
get him off.
arthur, that's enough.
arthur, come on!
come on, arthur, come on.
that's it. it's over.
arthur!
come on, shut up.
come on, come on.
he's still breathing.
don't get blood on the kid!
michael, you didn't see a thing. this didn't happen, all right?
give me the keys.
michael, give me the keys.
i'm all right to drive.
all right. go on. go on, go on!
tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
- right, let's get out of here, sharpish. -come on!
so?
how'd it go?
well, it was cold in the van, but it was super. really.
let me smell your breath.
did they behave themselves?
they were amazing, mum.
they were really amazing.
a vacancy has appeared and you're going to fill it.
from now on, mr shelby, you shut your gypsy mouth and listen to your instructions.
<i>i know it was you who carried out the murder of mr duggan.</i>
--you are on my hook, mr shelby.
- name? -harold hancox.
- have you ever been arrested? -no.
arthur, we can stand him up.
<i>last night, one of our men had his throat cut in winston green.</i>
i'm not real!
gentlemen? this is your cousin. polly's son, michael.
- i want to go with them. -over my dead body.
do we hear 800 guineas? 850.
<i>may carleton. i breed racehorses and train them.</i>
- so will you consider me? -i will consider you.
thomas shelby?
<i>did they behave themselves?</i>
they were really amazing.
you might think this is a curious place for me to suggest a meeting, but... your surprises have only just begun.
you look a little unsteady, mr shelby.
take a seat.
you're working together.
blowing up the garrison was your idea.
you chose me.
it's funny, i thought the fenians had a policy...
- enough. -eh? of not mixing the personal with the political.
- i said enough. -i think
i will decide on what is enough.
who's in charge here then, eh? who's in charge?
right, let me understand this.
- you answer to an agent of the crown.
- perhaps we can just...
- very interesting. -perhaps we can stick to the agenda.
- whose agenda? -there is a form of words here.
- whose words? -arrogant bastard.
i'm not accustomed to being spoken to like that. just come to order.
i am here to listen, but not to the fucking infantry.
enough! jesus!
now...
some weeks ago, mr shelby carried out a military mission on behalf of pro-treaty republicans here in birmingham.
you...
working for the king.
- there is a unique political situation. -yea h? how does that feel?
- let us... -tell me. how does that fucking feel?
...stick to the form of words.
- temporarily, we have a shared interest. -oh, i see.
- shall we just stop him laughing? -you want me to stop laughing?
explain this, pal.
following the success of your mission...
- we're going to make you do it again. -will you shut up?
can we just conduct ourselves here, please?
- conduct ourselves! -please.
no one in this room wants to breathe the same air as anyone else.
- nevertheless... -nevertheless the pro-treaty paddies and the king want the same man dead.
am i right?
- why him? -did you ask why in france?
- yeah. -so, it's the same answer, because.
why me?
- because. -because.
because if anybody connects me to this, it will be assumed that it was a criminal act and not a political one.
no, you need not fear being connected to the killing because i will see to it that no connection is ever made.
you will have complete immunity after the fact.
but, in the execution, you will get no help from agents of the crown.
and we can't be seen to be involved.
you have been chosen, mr shelby, and there really is no choice.
no equals bang, and your man here will shed no tears as he looks the other way.
nevertheless...
i say no.
mr shelby?
what about your export licence, mr shelby?
you had a deal with mr churchill.
the one with the mouth, donal henry, he is a spy.
he is working for the irregulars against the pro-treaty paddies.
he reports every fucking word back to them.
no, it's not possible.
they've both been security vetted by my own department.
i have men in places your men can't go.
donal henry meets the anti-treaty paddies in the back room of the mother red cap in saltley, sometimes twice a week.
these irish enemies are fucking brothers and cousins.
you are stepping into a world you don't understand.
if what you're saying is true, he'll be dealt with.
bring me proof the spy is dead and we have a deal.
mr shelby.
- billy boy. -watch it.
now on you go.
right. boys, let's go!
fuck you!
mario!
mario!
mario!
come here.
sabini's day is done.
i'll protect you now.
oh, shut up!
stop fucking whingeing.
due to my razor blade, and a few complaints from the neighbours about the terrible fucking music...
do you want to tell them or should i?
this place is under new management.
<i>by order of the peaky blinders.</i>
yes?
somebody to see you, mr shelby.
he says he's come about the position of accounts clerk.
send him in.
- just through here, sir.
- thank you.
michael...
vacancy's been filled.
not according to this morning's paper.
at school, i was top of the class in mathematics, and i did a night school course in accountancy at worcester college.
mum says you've had six different accountant clerks in the last six months.
when respectable men see the other things you do, they leave.
but i, like lizzie out there, already know what you do.
mum says you want to be 80% legal within two years.
- three. -i can help.
i know both sides and you know you can trust me.
i want to help you, tommy, become legal.
do the right thing.
i want to be proud of this family.
does polly know you're here, michael?
i'm 18 on friday, i go where i please.
you phone your mother.
good luck.
we're not open for winnings yet.
i'm here to see thomas shelby.
i have an appointment.
come in.
- may carleton.
- mr shelby has his proper meetings in his other office.
this was the address that he gave me.
- he gave you this address? -he said it was a gambling den.
i told him that i'd wanted to see one since i'm always reading about them in the papers.
quite the big scandal in the telegraph lately.
anyway, he said that i could come and have a look.
and now i feel like a bit of an idiot because i'm early and he's late and i have no idea how to behave.
in a gambling den?
i'll wait in the car.
if i open the door again, they'll all want to come in.
like flies.
so what are you?
what am i?
to thomas?
i'm going to train his racehorse... for epsom.
you know horses?
yes. you?
born riding.
i slept in a manger when i was a baby.
i was born riding, too.
there's a fucking great riley parked out there and nobody's watching it.
john, this woman says she's training thomas' horse.
he's told us a lot about you.
don't know where he is, do you?
sorry i'm late. there was a family matter.
esme, keep it locked up for a minute.
- yes, thomas. -i'll show you around.
so, be my guest.
that's my brother arthur's office.
down there is my brother john's office, that's where we slate the runners and the riders.
it's so out in the open. what about the police?
what about them?
when i drove into small heath, i thought i was going to get murdered...
then i mentioned your name.
it was like being escorted to see a king.
- you came here to get my girl, right? -right.
she looks in very good condition, considering she's not been out on the gallops.
curly's the best horseman in england.
i have a man called mickey who'd argue the point.
ah, curly here is half horse himself.
she's blessed. very blessed.
well, she's from the best stock.
but i'd rather have a coloured pony. mixed blood is stronger.
not to win the derby, curly.
don't like them racing, tommy, not the way they beat them.
- she's all yours. -thank you.
he gets sad when one leaves.
- what time is your box van coming? -midday.
maybe you've got time to take the lady to the garrison, show her the spa and the tearooms.
i'd like that, why not?
i just had it done up. there was a fire.
it's...
yeah.
what do you drink?
so early, but gin.
goodness. with something?
like what?
tonic water or...
erm... we have, erm...
cordial.
there's not much room in there but...
you want to fuck me, mrs carleton?
perhaps because i...
perhaps because i would represent something to you?
we should have this conversation before the booze starts talking for us.
you have a horse.
yes, i have a horse.
the horse is why i'm here.
purely that.
and because you're paying me a lot of money to train your horse, that's why i'm here.
purely that.
good.
good. well, a toast, then.
to the horse, to the derby.
- cheers. -cheers.
so is that what you say to women?
only if i don't know what they want.
and what if they don't want to fuck?
then life is simpler.
you want a simple life?
do i look like a man who wants a simple life, eh?
so what do you want?
for what i'm paying you, mrs carleton,
i want a horse that'll pay out at epsom on an each-way bet.
before i took your account,
i did some credit checks on you.
apparently, you don't exist.
my existence is questionable.
gypsies don't like registers.
you see, i'm not gypsy like you mean.
but you did register for france.
i also sent your name to the war office,
i have friends there.
you won two medals for gallantry.
does that really impress you, mrs carleton?
call me may.
charlie says the box van's here.
thank you, finn.
you know, i still don't know what you're going to call your horse.
the horse will be called grace's secret.
grace's secret.
i told him he definitely can't take the job.
he said, "all right, i'll move to london, then."
i said, "i won't give in to blackmail. no is no."
well... that settles it, then.
i'll give the job to the other candidate.
he's much better qualified anyway.
michael did city and guilds, six months.
yeah, but he doesn't know racing, poll.
he knows horses, but he doesn't know racing.
this other boy, he knows racing.
he's good. he's a fast learner.
what if michael really leaves?
you just got to let him go, poll.
he'll get a job in an office in london.
i'm sure he'll write to you.
he made a big speech about wanting to help you build up a respectable business.
oh, he's like his dad, he could make me cry.
there are trains to london.
so i just let him leave?
every month or so he'd be back.
unless, of course, he meets a girl.
then, who knows?
oh, my god.
you want him to do this job.
polly, i want what you want.
what about this other more qualified candidate?
mmm...
well, i lied, there isn't one.
how much you paying?
- the advertised rate. -like hell.
- three bob. -like hell.
- three and six. -four.
four it is.
- i love him, tom. -i know.
that's why i'll keep him away from the old business, put him charge of the new. agreed?
agreed.
well, finn, you've got two choices, mild or mild.
- mild. -there you go.
--here he is, look.
happy birthday, michael.
eighteen years old. you're a man today.
give him a drink, john boy.
- there you go, lad. -and after that, we'll go to find you a lady of the night.
arthur!
michael.
what's that?
so you're never late for work.
welcome to the business, michael.
- welcome to the business. -thank you.
right, come on, let's get him drunk. come here, you.
all right, whisky.
no whisky, he's at work tomorrow. give him only dark mild.
a toast.
- toast.
- to michael.
to michael.
you all right?
- what is it?just us? -just us.
we celebrating? just taste this.
what do you think, arthur?
yeah, it's good. good stuff, really nice.
too good for the garrison.
i suppose we could shift it to the toffs at the eden club.
why? what is it?
that is part of an export drive.
we now have a secure warehouse in camden town and secure passage to the poplar docks.
so, on monday morning, we'll be sending out our first export crates.
a crate of riley car spa res, bound for halifax, nova scotia.
where there's prohibition.
where there is prohibition.
all over canada and america, people are making their own booze in bathtubs.
but rich people in new york, in toronto and boston are still paying a lot of money for the real stuff.
so, on monday, the first shelby company crates will contain a thousand riley carburettors.
but hidden in the packing will be 500 bottles of the finest quality single malt scotch whisky.
and we shelbys, have a licence granted by the minister of the empire himself, which means our crates won't be searched.
and, polly, all of the whisky will be packed at the docks, so michael can do the books without being involved.
like i've been telling you all for a year now, motor cars are the future.
so, how is your life then, tom?
on the up, johnny, on the up.
but, tom, really, come on, how is it?
you know i hate to see you not even married yet.
i have a fine looking cousin, she'll make your life hell.
you deserve her!
we haven't had a good old wedding in a long time.
rather look inside these boxes, then, johnny?
what do i want to look at car parts, tommy, when i haven't even got a car?
faith in family's a fine thing, eh?
and i wouldn't even be counting.
twenty-five becomes 24, then 24 it is.
oh, you know i'm no good with numbers, tom.
and if 24 ever became 23, then that'd be tax.
we don't pay tax.
no, tom.
good man.
i put an iron door on, and we've put iron bars on the windows and across the skylights.
good.
so what will you be keeping in here, tommy?
temptation, billy. temptation.
morning, arthur. i was just passing.
i think i'm in fucking love.
drink!
she don't know where to look.
whisky, tommy?
no, i've got a long drive ahead.
you off home?
mmm-hmm. eventually.
to birmingham.
what's this?
olives.
yes, it's miscellaneous.
it's, erm, olives.
sticks, you know, with little bits of fucking onion and things.
that's what that is.
we've taken 600 pounds on olives.
yeah, with little bits of onion.
i told you, arthur...
the dealers sell the cocaine, we take a cut.
we don't sell direct.
the home secretary's cracking down and i don't want this, to fuck up everything else, you understand?
i understand.
how much of that 600 came out of your pocket?
it's under control.
i put you down here cos people are scared of you, arthur.
but if you don't straighten up, it'll be john's turn in london.
no need.
i can handle it.
it's under control?
it's under control.
fucking tidy profit, though, eh?
it's happening, tom.
good.
good.
straighten up, soldier.
yes, sir, sergeant major.
what's your business?
sorry, i'm, er, i'm lost here.
yeah, well, you can't stop here.
- move on. -all right.
twenty-three seconds.
it's all right, ada, it'll be andrew for me.
oh.
i'm looking for ada.
who are you?
ada.
i asked you a question.
it's all right, james.
this is my brother.
who's he?
he rents a room.
you need to rent out rooms?
actually, she doesn't charge rent.
he's a writer, which means he's skint.
you get up late these days, ada.
mmm. i go to bed late.
yeah? where's karl?
what do you want, tommy?
oh, god, before you start sizing him up for a wedding suit, he's not interested in me.
- or in girls of any kind. -ada!
what? tommy wonâ€™t judge you.
he sure as hell won't go to the police.
look, i'll go and get dressed.
james...
i'm thomas.
pleased to meet you.
can i have a minute with my sister, please?
yes, of course.
so, does your lodger know your name?
yeah. thorne.
you think i'd tell anybody anything else?
your brummie boys are all over the papers.
just one last push, eh? then you'll go legit?
just one more obstacle to get round, then it'll all be straight?
actually, yes.
personally, i find it quite amusing.
men like you are becoming very fashionable down here.
no society party in london is complete without a gangster for the girls to go giddy for.
anyway, what is it that you want?
i don't have any children, ada, so i have set up a trust fund.
the beneficiaries will be john's kids and karl.
in order for karl to benefit, i need your signature.
i've set up an account.
the money will be transferred in the event of my death.
it'll set them up for a new life.
are you sick?
i'm just doing what any ordinary man would, putting my affairs in order.
<i>did you know they was going to take the eden club?</i>
i know about the eden club, yes.
did you know they were going to do it before they did it?
because that's someone who's in charge, isn't it?
the one who knows before it happens.
i know what i know, you know.
if you don't know, then you don't fucking know, do you?
did you know they was going to take wimbledon docks?
harringay? the trotting tracks?
talk, all right? i genuinely want to hear you.
you've lost control, alfie.
have i?
everybody knows.
- talk to me, alfie. -talk to you?
all right, i'll talk to you. i'll fucking tell you how it was, right?
what happened was this.
all the time you were talking about dirty fucking jews.
all the fucking time, dirty fucking jews, dirty kikes, dirty dustbin lids...
- everyone makes jokes. -you want to talk about
-not getting into places? -everybody makes fucking jokes.
i didn't know you had no sense of humour!
and i ain't going to fucking mention, right, the great big fuck off elephant in the room.
look, alfie...
how many of my bookies worked epsom this last may?
none. none.
not one.
so, for a few fucking jokes and epsom, you fucking invite a tribe of savages into the city and just fucking unlock the fucking gates!
i'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?
i'm saying...
i'm sorry about the jew thing.
- you saying you're sorry? -yeah.
- you're sorry about the jew thing? -yeah.
- really? -yea h.
i want that in writing. write that down. he said, "i'm sorry".
and also write down that all our bookies can go back to epsom.
- he didn't say that. -who's asking you?
eh.
write it down.
it's all right. come on.
alfie's an old friend.
my friend.
now, admit it, the peaky blinders is out of control.
yeah, they're out of fucking control, mate.
they come down the canal, they spread like the fucking clap.
right. so now they're
-everybody's problem. -yeah.
- alfie. -mmm.
you and me, we've been fighting
-since we was at school. -yeah.
all right? now, also,
-we've been friends. -mmm, yeah.
you know, it goes backwards and forwards.
how much better is it when we're friends?
oh, it's much better, mate, yeah.
you write that down.
mmm.
so what we're doing here, right, is we're writing down some kind of a deal thing, right?
- yeah, a written deal. -written deal, good.
well, why don't we discuss the border between the italians and the jews going back to farringdon road.
- farringdon road... -yeah, farringdon road.
fuck! that's ancient history.
- write down farringdon road. -no, no, no, write down camden road.
- farringdon road. -camden road.
- write down farringdon. -camden.
- farringdon. -camden.
write down camden road.
just write down "peace".
just write down "peace", right, between the jews and the italians.
and war against the gypsies.
fuck.
mr thomas shelby, madam.
nice house.
would you like a whisky?
scotch or irish?
irish.
sorry for the short notice.
i was passing.
we're not quite on the birmingham road.
it was a small diversion.
sixty miles, i checked.
that's a small diversion these days.
so, i'm a small diversion.
good.
your horse is still out on the gallops, but i had mickey prepare this report.
you can read it now if you'd like, then we can go see her.
--is there enough light for you to read?
yes, it's fine.
it's getting quite late.
mickey says she has the lungs of an elephant.
she's nimble in the heavy going, but bounces a little on the hard ground.
sorry, i'll let you read.
so, he thinks she'll favour good to soft ground, eh?
- a little juice in the grass. -mmm.
well, that's good for epsom.
does he think she's not good enough for epsom?
she needs a lot of work.
the race board will need convincing.
- i imagine you have some influence. -mmm.
that's the suggested programme for the next two months.
your glass is empty.
it's fine.
are you hungry?
yes, a bit.
i can prepare something.
do you have engine oil?
before i set off for birmingham, the car needs oil.
i'm sure my husband kept some in the garage.
i can get someone to do it.
this evening or tomorrow?
well, we're so far from anywhere, people usually stay over.
especially before cars, when it was just carriages, people used to stay over all the time.
but i have a car.
yes.
and you have engine oil.
probably.
but it would be very usual.
what would?
for a guest to stay.
we have a whole wing called the guest wing.
oh, you...
you have a guest wing.
well...
may.
have a smoke.
thank you.
ignore this. it's actually all right.
i put all his photos in a drawer and locked it...
as if that was going to make a difference.
i'm like a fucking lighthouse keeper...
out here on my own...
keeping his flame burning.
but, of course, when anyone sees a lighthouse they steer clear, don't they?
now, do you have a map?
of the house. do you have a map?
because i'm not going to be able to find my way in the dark.
you see, at midnight,
i'm going to leave my wing and i'm going to come find you.
and i'm going to turn the handle of your bedroom door without making a sound and none of the maids will know.
you don't know maids.
they hear a pin drop?
if there's a man in the house, they listen.
they take turns.
so, let them listen.
right. day rate, seven shillings. loading, unloading.
night rate, three. total ten.
let's go and get a drink.
no, i'm all right.
come on, it's payday.
everybody has a drink on payday.
not me.
you think your mum don't have a drink on payday?
you think the lord almighty don't have a drink on payday?
man, it's on fire out there, women from the bsa offices, honest.
they go out on their own without their men these days, in twos and threes now.
mickey, they go out in twos and threes and buy their own drinks.
the marquis, that's where the bsa secretaries go.
look, they won't serve a black man without a shelby by his side.
so you're using me?
yeah.
come on.
i told you, i fucking told you, this city's gone mad.
girls go out on their own now.
two pints of dark mild, please.
fuck that. we're peaky boys.
two whiskies.
you get used to it, then you can't stop.
i don't drink with blacks.
here we fucking go.
paddy, they're okay.
not with me, they're not.
i don't drink in pubs with blacks.
so leave.
look, my dad is the preacher round here.
he has connections, ask anybody.
i couldn't give a fuck who he is.
i'm telling you to leave it, paddy.
and i'm telling this darkie to get out of here.
you know something? fuck off.
it's all right, isaiah, come on, leave it.
- we'll go to my cousin's pub. -i like it here.
you fucking nigger.
paddy! the white kid's a peaky blinder!
he's polly shelby's son!
he's polly shelby's son! are you fucking suicidal?
sir...
sir, i'm sorry, i didn't know.
get out!
get out the fucking pub.
i clearly didn't know.
fuck, let's go. let's go!
we ordered some drinks and we're going to drink them.
his face, man. did you see his fucking face?
you punch like a fucking kangaroo.
i seen one once in a circus, you punch like that.
all right, anyway, i need a fucking drink.
- it's on you. -it's on me? you just got paid.
yeah, from you.
you can get a whisky, maybe even a dark mild.
fucking hell, it's packed in here, isn't it?
so it's as easy as that?
easy as that, john boy. london, you wouldn't believe it.
finn, stick your head in a bucket.
no.
the women, john boy, the women...
i've got this one, she's a dancer, right?
she can do things with her...
if finn would just piss off, i'd explain a little bit better.
well, if it's so good, why are you here?
decent pints.
the cockneys can't get that right.
he misses us, finn, that's what it is.
here they are, look, junior peaky boys.
what's happened to you? you been scrapping?
some idiots at the marquis of lorne.
tried to stop me and isaiah from drinking, but it's all right.
we fought them off.
arthur, we had to stand our ground and we did.
the marquis, eh? where's your dad?
- preaching. -right.
don't nick any of me chips, finn!
- where are you going?
- we won't be long.
where are they going?
the marquis of lorne.
shame.
it was a nice pub.
eh-up. bet the big bastard got cut.
you didn't have to do that for me.
we didn't do it for you, michael.
we did it for the good name of the company.
none of this happened, all right?
come on, let's go and get that drink.
the date has been set.
three weeks from today.
you checked out his house?
there's coppers all over it.
you'll take care of them?
no. that would arouse suspicion.
you'll have to deal with them yourself.
and if a copper gets killed?
there will be no consequences for you, i have given you my word.
which i know to be worthless.
that is why i have been settling my affairs in the event of my death.
and making your peace with god, perhaps?
well, good luck with that.
i have made arrangements with men i trust.
if i should die, then you will die.
know that.
ritz hotel.
london, piccadilly.
hello?
<i>hello?</i>
- who was that? -call got cut.
<i>i guess the telephone lines in england are not so good, huh?</i>
hm.
this place is under new management.
<i>by order of the peaky blinders.</i> just write down "peace", right, between the jews and the italians.
and war against the gypsies.
<i>- i love him, tom.</i> <i>- i know.</i>
that's why i'll keep him away from the old business, put him charge of the new.
<i>some idiots at the marquis of lorne.</i>
tried to stop me and isaiah from drinking, but it's all right.
we fought them off.
the marquis, eh?
what do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
when we make our move on sabini's racing pitches,
<i>a good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.</i>
may carleton. i breed racehorses and train them.
<i>i've made arrangements with men i trust.</i>
if i should die, then you will die.
thanks.
would you stop the noise?
you working tonight?
not so much work as pleasure.
others are doing my work for me tonight.
gentlemen, welcome!
welcome!
mr solomon.
you must be arthur.
- that is right. -arthur!
- arthur! -pleasure to meet you, sir.
i've heard so much about you.
shalom. let me just say.
shalom.
for luck.
you understand i'm the commanding officer on this operation.
you're here purely as an observer.
just do your duty.
dear lord, for what we're about to receive may the lord make us truly grateful.
amen.
amen.
amen.
passover started off way out there in the far east, out in the sand, out in the desert, where me forefathers come from.
you know, the jews, the brews, whatever you want to call them.
it started out as a little speck on the horizon.
arthur, this ain't right.
billy, don't worry, mate, you know what i mean? if you want, you can leave.
if you need to go to the little boys' room, you can leave.
we going to open 'em in a minute.
he's all right, he's all right, billy boy.
- do you want to leave? -no, you're all right.
- you want to stay? -i'll stay.
you stay there, then, treacle.
okay, so the pharaoh. have you heard of him?
he kept my people, the jewish people, in slavery, for thousands and thousands of years.
persecuted race.
he did, he persecuted my race.
the killing of the innocent, right?
<i>seder, this feast, that what we is having here.</i>
<i>seder is basically the day what when the jewish angels decided,</i>
<i>you know, that the evil fucking egyptians</i>
<i>had pushed their fucking luck!</i>
<i>right.</i>
<i>it is part of our tradition to do with seder, right,</i>
<i>that in order to make it good with god to kill a king,</i>
<i>we have to carry out the korban pesach.</i>
- right. -that, is the ritual sacrifice of the passover goat.
- it's a goat. -yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it.
<i>tonight. that's part of the reason why we have to shut the doors as well.</i>
but this year we thought we'd give the fucking goat a name.
- you've named it? -we fucking did, yeah.
- they named the fucking goat. -the evil fucking egyptian pharaoh,
-the fucking enemy. -that's right.
- you know what we called it? -what did ya call him?
tommy shelby.
- stay where you are!
you're all fired.
- fuck you.
- that's right, let's take a load off.
so...
and the evil egyptian scum...
...was finally cleansed, with the blood of the passover goat, mate.
that's from sabini.
and tell your gypsy king...
...whoever comes down south, shall return north in many fucking pieces. huh?
this fucking animal. he come in here, right, with a fucking gun and razor and he shot him in the face!
and my lads, they restrained him.
look at him. he's dead. is he dead?
he's fucking dead!
he wants arresting or something, right?
surely.
michael! you can't take him away again, you can't take my son away!
you come back here! no! no!
ow!
don't you fucking touch him! get off him!
don't say anything! tommy will get you out!
fuck!
i'll be all right...
you should know, that as of this night, tommy shelby is finished.
mick? this is thomas shelby, he's come to check up on his filly.
yes, i've heard about you.
mick is the best horseman in england.
he likes to waste money, i know that.
according to the reports i've been given, you're spending two pound a month on worming powder.
what? you want a horse with worms?
horses get worms from the water trough.
put goldfish in them, they eat the worm eggs.
goldfish?
- it'll be a gypsy thing, is it? -no.
it's an accounting thing.
- goldfish cost a penny each. -or you can win them at the fair.
if you want, i'll dispense with the vet altogether. excuse me.
did you ever consider a career in diplomacy?
hello, hello.
how are you, eh?
goldfish, seriously?
yup.
you people have a lot to learn.
they asked me if i wanted a fire in the guest bedroom.
i said no.
just one fire tonight.
bold and fearless, eh?
yes.
though i'm not really fearless.
- drink? -why not?
- madam, there is a telephone call. -i'll take it in the drawing room.
it's for mr shelby.
we had a deal.
hey!
we had a fucking deal.
i would thank you to moderate your language in a place of worship.
we had a fucking deal.
mr shelby.
if you read the papers, you might have seen that the home secretary has got himself into a bit of a fizz about certain moral issues.
prostitution.
protection, racketeering, drinking, cocaine and, of course, gambling.
and he's demanded results.
you offered me protection.
you promised me protection.
well, no, you see, it was mr churchill that made you that promise.
and the home secretary outranks him, so...
and i can hardly be blamed if your demented brother decides to go on some sort of blood orgy during dinner.
do not fucking lie to me.
do not sit here in your fucking church and lie to me!
you will need to contain your emotions or this meeting is at an end.
good.
that's better.
so...
let us review the new situation.
i have your brother in a prison cell, charged with the murder of billy kitchen.
the case against him is strong.
and i have no doubt that his destiny is to hang.
and then there is polly's son michael.
he has already admitted to helping arthur burn down the marquis pub.
oh, he was a tough nut to crack, that boy.
but crack he did.
so i have your brother facing the noose.
i have your cousin facing five years for arson.
and i have your entire organisation in disarray in birmingham and in london.
what do you want?
what do i want?
i don't understand.
i've already agreed to do your fucking killing for you.
now what is it you want from me?
oh. there you go, you see...
an agreement is not the same thing as an assurance, now, is it?
see, i found that
i wasn't sleeping so well.
and it wasnâ€™t just that...
...the smell and the noise in that room, no.
it was the nagging doubt. the knowledge.
the knowledge that...
tommy shelby is not afraid to die.
and therefore, the threat to your own life might not be enough to make it certain that you will obey me on the given day.
i needed also the power of life and death over your family and that i now have.
your brother, your cousin and your sister.
i've known her address in primrose hill since the day she moved in.
now she is safe only as long as i want her to be.
i've been ahead of you, every step of the way.
and, as my father used to say, to make sure your dog obeys you, you have to show it the stick once in a while.
tommy, arthur's in solitary confinement. michael's in remand wing...
yeah, i already know. get out, shut the doors.
<i>tommy?</i>
<i>it's me.</i>
tommy, can you hear me?
yes, grace.
i think you called.
i haven't slept.
grace, this is not a good time.
<i>i can call you back.</i>
- no, no, it's fine. it's all right. -can we meet?
yes, we'll meet.
when?
grace, there are some things i have to do first.
john?
coppers have lifted 10 of our men in camden town, the rest of them on the run.
- tom, they've taken michael. -business first.
- they took michael last night. -polly, business first!
john?
they took all our whisky.
so no doubt they'll be supping that for christmas.
they've impounded all our vans, put their own locks on the warehouse.
the eden club and all our pubs have been raided by the coppers and handed back to sabini and solomons.
the black country boys think it was arthur who killed billy because that's what the coppers told them.
so there'll be no more free passes for our whisky boats.
i don't give a fuck about whisky.
i don't give a fuck about billy kitchen.
i want my son out of prison now.
thomas, i spoke to johnny dogs.
this meeting should just be family.
- i can help. -it's family only, she's not blood.
- let her speak. -tommy! or is this a business...
enough!
enough, polly.
esme.
i spoke to johnny dogs. the lees are kin.
- the bloody lees! -they can give us men.
we don't need more fucking men.
it's men that have done the damage. it's...
it is men fighting like cockerels that have put us here in the first place.
esme, i'll take up their offer. we need men.
if michael ever gets out of prison,
i am taking him away from this family, for good.
this life is bad.
this life is all bad.
- aunt pol, what are you doing? -shut up and walk.
thomas.
should i go and speak to queen mary lee at the black patch?
yes.
she can give us soldiers for a few nights.
mmm, good.
john, go bring up the car.
imagine riding away, thomas.
living the real life, you know?
your gypsy half is the stronger.
you just want to ride away.
france is the new place for us, they say.
lot of metal lying around still.
guns and trucks and spent shells and things.
then you go south.
saintes maries.
where the black madonna is.
my brothers go sometimes for the fair.
it's like a home for us.
they still let you get lost there.
i've been to france, esme.
so has john.
now get your coat and go with your husband.
if you ever talk about getting lost again, i'll cut you from this family.
what family?
- come in.
ah. polly.
i've come to see my son.
close the door.
i've just been conducting an interrogation.
it can be awfully hard on the hands.
my son. michael. where is he?
do you think i need a shave?
it's been a long day.
i need a shave, don't you think?
well, maybe it can wait till later.
your son has been having a hard time of it i'm told.
and that is why i thought that you and i together, we should do whatever we can to get him freed.
now, i have a form here, a release form.
with my signature, he can be freed by tomorrow morning at dawn.
so sign it.
- he didn't do anything. -"sign it,
"mr campbell. please, sir."
something like that. that would be a way to say that, wouldn't it?
now, what would prompt me to do you such a favour, hmm?
what do you want?
information?
you mean inside information about tommy shelby's criminal empire?
with respect,
i would say i know more about tommy's dealings than you do.
he doesn't trouble the family with irish business for instance, does he?
no.
so, no.
it's not information i need.
what else could you give me in return for my signature?
i'm talking about a simple transaction here.
i have a great curiosity.
like a magpie sees something, something shining in the mud.
oh, he has no need for the silver, but he takes it anyway.
sign the form.
-"please, sir." -please, sir.
i will sign that form with this hand when i am finished.
- it's a deal? -it's a deal.
- don't cry. -oh, i can cry.
so...
that is what i want.
i need you to cry.
i will try.
"i need a favour, mr campbell, sir.
"and i will do anything, anything in return."
that's what you might have said. hmm?
i felt something when i had you up against that car.
and you felt it too.
don't tell me you didn't, polly, because...
oh, and now you think you're...
you're so respectable, with your son and your house and your maid, but i know what you are, gypsy fenian slut.
do you want to do it on the floor or on the desk, mr campbell?
now you cry.
you cry!
get out. get out.
get out!
no. no! i want him free.
i'll get him free.
you don't need to shave.
you don't need to do anything.
a victory is just doing nothing as well.
doing it soft and gentle.
should i talk or not talk?
should it be like i'm weak and small, yes?
do you want me to talk or not to talk?
talk.
you're small and weak.
that's what i am...
small and weak.
look.
you made me cry.
no!
we had an agreement, right?
yes. yes!
where have you been?
went to the spotted dog in digbeth.
a glass or two of rum.
was it one glass or two?
it was three.
where's the baby?
sleeping.
more like five.
it was more like six.
did you meet the maid?
talked politics with her and she got bored and went to bed.
i phoned james.
he talked to the lawyer anyway.
said he'd take arthur's case for free, so we don't need tommy.
pol?
we'll get michael free as well, i promise.
there's no need, they'll let him out in the morning.
if the baby wants anything at night, ring the bell by the bed.
she gets paid to work 24 hours, that girl. she's getting lazy.
well...
take advantage if you're nice.
you need cream on them cuts or they'll go bad.
the screws told me why i've been freed.
they told me what you did.
they thought it was funny.
maybe it is.
what are you doing, tommy?
shovelling shit, curly.
just like you.
why're you doing that, tommy?
to remind meself what i'd be if i wasn't who i am.
tommy. what's going on?
i think tommy's lost his mind, charlie.
well, it's honest work, curly.
but i don't want to get used to it.
so i'll need six cans of petrol.
bring them to the garage.
put them in the back of the car.
six cans?
tommy.
if you ever want a job, i'll get you your own shovel.
petrol. yes. yeah.
you're far too gorgeous for some half-blind auntie.
she's my harshest critic.
i have to be perfect.
she's not half-blind, she's half-deaf.
so what time will you be back?
before midnight.
i'll be awake.
is this your house?
yes.
have a seat.
do i not get a drink?
please.
- you want one? -yes.
still whisky?
yes.
but other things have changed.
i saw vans with your name on at the docks.
yes, some things have changed.
tommy, i really wasn't sure about coming tonight.
i lit a fire in the bedroom upstairs.
my plan was that we'd sit here for a while, talk about old times, drink some whisky.
and i was gonna tell you
i hadn't spent a day without thinking about you.
and then we were gonna go upstairs and sleep together.
but just now on the way to opening the door,
i changed me mind.
so just have one drink tell me how happy you are in new york and then you can go.
- you changed your mind? -mmm.
so you can go.
well...
as a matter of fact,
i am happy in new york.
and i am married.
oh, yeah, he's... he's rich. i know.
and he's sweet.
and he's kind to me.
so what makes you think that i would have gone to bed with you after one whisky and some conversation?
i was accounting for three whiskys.
how dare you?
it doesn't matter now, 'cause i've changed me mind.
i came here because you asked me.
even though he's sweet and he's kind to you?
and now i feel like an idiot.
well, then, go.
jesus.
well, you're still here.
are you so certain?
that you're still in love with me?
i was.
but i'm not any more.
you're not armed, grace, are you?
no, i'm not armed.
i don't carry guns. i don't have to.
you don't have a sense of humour any more, either.
what are you talking about?
the thing is, i hate reunions.
i didn't want to sit here for hours talking about nothing and dancing around what we really want to say.
so now,
i know you're happy in new york.
i know your husband's rich and sweet and kind to you.
i know you're unarmed.
and you didn't come here for sex because you don't love me any more.
and it's only three minutes past.
another drink?
i'll take that as a yes.
it's good to see you, grace.
so you didn't light the fire?
you see, my real plan was that we go out.
i want to impress you.
now, do you like charlie chaplin?
yes, i like charlie chaplin.
good.
i bet you've never heard charlie chaplin speak.
i thought you were taking me to see charlie chaplin.
i am.
- this isn't a picture house. -no, it's not a picture house.
so how will i see charlie chaplin?
you will see him and you will hear him, just like i promised.
there you go. there's chaplin.
- oh, my god. that's him. -mmm-hmm.
that's really charlie chaplin in person.
yep. he's in england promoting his film.
and how the hell do you know charlie chaplin?
i don't. i know his bodyguard, wag mcdonald.
it's that chap there.
wag was a bookie in birmingham, then he went to los angeles.
you see, wag is also romani gypsy, as is chaplin, but he keeps it a secret.
chaplin was born on the black patch, a gypsy camp in birmingham.
that's why he gave wag the job, even though wag was on the run.
thank you.
thank you. see, we all have our secrets, grace.
come on. i'll introduce you.
hello, wag. mr chaplin, this is grace.
hello, mr chaplin.
- hello. <i>- hello, mr campbell.</i>
<i>uh, you said you knew my sister's address in primrose hill,</i>
<i>so i expect you have men watching the house,</i>
<i>see who comes and goes.</i>
well, tonight your men will see me return to the house with a very beautiful woman.
she will stay until just before midnight.
of course, i'll close the curtains.
can you guess who the woman is?
liar!
sleep well, mr campbell.
tommy.
tommy, do you have someone?
it's too late, tommy.
it's 11:00, grace.
i mean, it's too late.
if you'd come with me to new york...
i have things to do.
you mean the coin landed the wrong way?
it couldn't have worked.
that was a question.
hey.
tommy, do you have someone?
i have a racehorse.
she's gonna win the derby.
i'll drive you.
when do you sail back?
we don't know yet.
you don't have a return ticket?
this wasn't right, tommy.
when do you go back, grace?
they're doing tests on us.
i don't know when they'll be finished.
we're having treatment.
a doctor on harley street.
some new thing, a breakthrough.
we're trying for a baby.
why did you come here tonight?
the doctor believes it's surely me who's at fault.
i'm sorry.
it's no one's fault.
i'm tired of that, tommy.
can i see you again?
grace.
you're used to working undercover, eh?
i've never lied to him once.
so tell him the truth.
put your arms up.
oh, what've we got here then?
get your fuckin' hands off me.
oh, here he is.
the king of london town.
you been enjoying yourself?
oh, yeah, it's fucking great.
surrounded by sabini's men.
rats everywhere.
fucking cockneys.
well, at least you're going to get what you've always wanted.
and what's that?
well, you tried to hang yourself twice.
now the king is gonna do it for you.
- i've been a fuckin' idiot. -yeah.
i haven't appreciated nothing, john.
are you fucking repenting or something?
drawing.
i used to be good at drawing.
arthur, please, for god's sake, i don't need this.
i should have listened more in class.
what fucking class? you were never there.
i used to draw horses.
- arthur... -stallions.
- great big ones. -arthur.
- they looked real. -not stallions. not now.
i should have done more with me life, john.
- good things. -arthur, for god's sake...
even ada said it wasn't my fault.
arthur, will you listen?
- they're gonna hang me, john. -they're not gonna hang you.
says who?
tommy.
and how is houdini gonna get me out of this?
- well, we... -don't tell me. he's got a plan.
but you don't know what that plan is, do you, john?
i do...
'cause we just can't be trusted.
all right.
if he's so fucking clever, why am i in here?
well, it's...
why is all our men and half our whisky been lifted?
hmm?
the jew and the cockney have run rings round him.
- will you shut up? -look at you. look.
- a big fucking man... -fucking shut up!
he's already told me what i've got to do.
what business have you got here?
i just pulled over.
i never smoke and drive, you know?
- where are you from? -i'm from ireland, the beautiful north where the rocks sing in the wind.
yeah, in the beautiful north.
you know, i've just pulled over for a fag.
i want to see some identification!
hey!
look.
come!
see?
does it really stop the horses from getting worms?
yep. it really does.
anyway, i thought it would make you smile.
i'm sorry that you had to drive through the night.
you must be exhausted. you can go and sleep if you want.
may.
we have to stop.
this.
i came here to tell you we have to stop.
why?
because i'm me and you're you, that old thing?
there's someone.
for a long time.
and i didn't want you to think anything about how it's gonna be after the race.
not many of your people know about me, so i haven't done the damage that would come.
"my people?"
well, the damage isn't done, is what i mean.
- right. -it's...
even if it's like this, i want the horse to stay here.
to stay? yes, of course.
epsom is close.
i haven't got my outfit yet so it's all right.
you can still be with me at the enclosure.
that's very gracious of you, sir.
you can wear something.
it's funny, isn't it?
because you'll be up there and i'll be down in the ring.
sort of upside down, isn't it?
you can still be with me after and you can still wear something.
i'll be covered in mud from the ring.
may, forget about men like me.
i was going to tell you how much he's improved.
there are other men, may.
i think she stands a chance of placing, so...
that's the silly part of our business done.
are you going to drive straight off to birmingham? or...
and what if i said, uh,
"all right, i'll stay," after what i just said?
then that would be all right.
you talk about damage.
the damage not yet done.
you don't think that half of london already thinks that i'm fucking a racketeer?
laughing about it. laying on bets about when you'll steal the silver.
you think your people are ruthless? try mine.
so that's why you carry on, eh?
because you can't back down.
amongst many other illogical reasons.
so will you drive straight off or...
i haven't got any petrol in the garage.
yeah. i have some cans of petrol in the car.
good. so you can go.
they look happy in there, eh?
and why wouldn't they be?
who is she?
someone who's sailing away.
so let her sail.
you've told me about her like a gentleman.
now kindly behave like a gangster again.
feel sorry for me. it's fine.
because your horse will come fifth or sixth.
but i will win you.
mr shelbyâ€™s just parking his car. he said for you to wait in here.
isn't this impressive?
and what is it you exactly do here?
i exactly am a secretary to mr shelby.
a secretary? my, my, my.
all that paperwork.
do you want tea?
no.
i keep everything locked up, mr campbell.
everything of value.
take a seat.
how is your company treasurer, polly?
- why do you ask? -oh, just give her my regards.
you like to play with fire, don't you, mr shelby?
yesterday in belgravia,
field marshal russell's house was burnt out.
an incendiary device was put through his letterbox, which means that he will have to find somewhere else to live for at least the next three months.
hmm.
which also means that your plan, for me to break in and shoot him in his bed, is now no longer an operational possibility.
indeed.
but if you think a wee burn frees you from your obligations,
-think again. -i will keep my side of the bargain.
oh, by god, you will.
i will shoot your field marshal, but i will do it in a way that serves my purpose.
the only purpose is my purpose.
i will carry out your assassination at a place of my choosing.
listen to me.
all operational detail must be mutually agreed.
i'm a soldier. i've experience. i will determine where and when he...
now that man has 24-hour armed police protection...
your plan was full of holes.
my plan was mutually agreed!
well, now your plan is up in smoke.
and i have formulated the only viable alternative.
oh, for god's sake, what do you mean?
how would you get to him?
i won't. he will come to me.
now, listen to me, mr shelby.
when this meeting is concluded,
i must report directly to mr winston churchill.
your relationship with mr churchill is not my concern.
and mr winston churchill will need to hear detail.
well, you tell him he'll have to trust me.
look, mr campbell.
i will carry out my mission.
- good. -good.
but i will do it in a place where it will be impossible for you or your men to have me shot afterwards.
because that was the plan.
eh?
coppers front and back. no way out.
me shot dead, dumped in the thames.
i will do the killing, but at a place where that will not be an option.
i've recently become a racehorse owner, mr campbell.
it's, uh...
well, perhaps you can guess which one is my horse.
where and when?
epsom.
derby day.
<i>the pro-treaty paddles and the king want the same man dead.</i>
you've been chosen, mr shelby.
the epsom derby, pol. we'll be drinking with the bloody king.
for the last 10 years, sabini's made it his race.
<i>if we're gonna take him down, might as well make it there.</i>
it's good to see you, grace.
tommy, do you have someone?
<i>the horse will come fifth or sixth. but i will win you.</i>
mr churchill was impressed.
he has asked that the colonial office grant him an empire export licence.
i want my son out of prison now.
<i>he can be freed by tomorrow morning.</i>
<i>i'm talking about a simple transaction here.</i>
<i>i will carry out your assassination</i>
<i>at a place of my choosing.</i>
epsom.
derby day.
<i>my name is thomas shelby,</i>
<i>and today, i'm going to kill a man.</i>
<i>today is derby day.</i>
<i>the murder will take place this afternoon,</i>
<i>at the epsom races.</i>
<i>it may be that i am able to escape after the killing.</i>
<i>the odds are not good, which is why i am writing this letter.</i>
<i>i've been forced by agents of the crown to carry out this murder.</i>
<i>in the event of my own death, i want the following facts to be known.</i>
<i>my family are innocent of any involvement.</i>
who are we?
- let's go.
<i>and while some of them may be guilty of other things,</i>
<i>i've not shared details of this mission with any of them,</i>
<i>and no company assets were used.</i>
<i>agents of the crown joined forces with pro-treaty fenians</i>
<i>to arrange this murder.</i>
<i>i believe the governments intend to falsely blame the anti-treaty ira.</i>
<i>therefore, the bullet i fire this afternoon</i>
<i>will be the starting gun for civil war in ireland.</i>
<i>the man i have been instructed to kill</i>
<i>is field marshal russell.</i>
<i>formerly a black and tan commander who committed many atrocities</i>
<i>in the county of cork.</i>
<i>there is no remorse in my heart at the prospect of his death.</i>
<i>however, the conspiracy behind the killing</i>
<i>is cause for international concern.</i>
<i>such is the gravity of my secret mission,</i>
<i>that after i have served my purpose, i believe they intend to kill me.</i>
do you want tea?
<i>i therefore want to name a particular individual in this letter.</i>
<i>the agent who has initiated and orchestrated this crime</i>
<i>is major chester campbell of the british secret intelligence service.</i>
<i>he chose me for this dirty business as an act of vengeance,</i>
<i>prompted by hatred of long standing.</i>
<i>in the event of my death,</i>
<i>it is imperative he be brought to justice.</i>
<i>if you are reading this, then i am dead already.</i>
<i>i hope that, living as you do in a truly free country,</i>
<i>you will be able to make the above facts known to the world.</i>
<i>yours sincerely, thomas shelby.</i>
did you one anyway, you ignorant git.
ada, sit down here for a minute.
ada, if anything happens to me today,
i need you to post this letter.
the stamp's already on.
don't ask any questions, it's to do with insurance.
look, tommy, whatever it is you're involved in, just tell us.
god, you never let anybody in.
we love you, tom.
what are you doing up at 6:00 in the morning?
- ready?
- what the bloody hell's going on?
- little errand. -what errand?
- you just have to stand there, ada. -stand where?
- let's go, come on. flames, what's going on?
don't listen to him, james. he'll get you killed.
what errand?
for the cause, ada.
the good old cause.
hands off cocks, on with socks.
one at a time.
one at a time, that's all i ask.
you're getting out, mr shelby.
all 10 witnesses against you withdrew their statements, last night.
all at once. 9:00.
don't ask me why, because i don't know.
the next 10 minutes, you don't do or say anything i haven't told you.
all right?
- all right? -yeah.
hello, ollie.
well, hang on. just you, yeah?
he stays out here.
uh, you stay here.
johnny fucking dogs.
how did they get me out of there?
i need to get you to a telephone. you need to make a call.
it's all part of tommy's plan.
apparently.
that'll probably be for you, won't it?
hello?
arthur.
you're out.
right, so that'll be your side of the street swept up, won't it?
where's mine?
what you got for me?
signed by the minister of the empire himself.
yeah? so it is.
this means that you can put your rum in our shipments, and no one at poplar docks will lift a canvas.
you know what? i'm not even going to have my lawyer look at that.
- i know, it's all legal.
- you know what, mate, i trust you. that's that. done.
so, whisky...
there is, uh, one thing, though, that we do need to discuss.
- what would that be? -it says here, "20%
"paid to me of your export business."
- as we agreed on the telephone... -no, no, no, no, no.
see, i've had my lawyer draw this up...
...for us, just in case.
it says that, here, that 100% of your business goes to me.
- i see. -it's there. right.
don't worry about it, right, 'cause it's totally legal binding.
all you have to do is sign the document and transfer the whole lot over to me.
- sign just here, is it? -yeah.
i see. that's funny. that is.
- what? -no, that's funny.
"i'll give you 100% of my business."
yeah.
why?
ollie, no. no, no, no.
put that down. he understands, he understands.
he's a big boy, he knows the road. now, look, it's just non-fucking-negotiable.
that's all you need to know.
so all you have to do is sign the fucking contract.
- right there. -just sign here?
- with your pen. -i understand.
good. get on with it.
well, i have an associate waiting for me at the door.
i know that he looks like a choir boy, but he is actually an anarchist
- from kentish town. -tommy...
i'm going to fucking shoot you.
all right?
now, when i came in here, mr summons,
i stopped to tie my shoelace. isn't that a fact?
ollie?
i stopped to tie my shoelace.
and while i was doing it,
i laid a hand grenade on one of your barrels,
mark 15, with wired trip.
and my friend upstairs...
well, he's like one of those anarchists that blew up wall street, you know?
he's a professional.
and he's in charge of the wire.
if i don't walk out that door on the stroke of 7:00, he's going to trigger the grenade and...
...your very combustible rum will blow us all to hell.
and i don't care...
...'cause i'm already dead.
he tied his lace, alfie.
- and there is a kid at the door. -from a good family, too.
ollie, it's shocking what they become...
what were you doing when this happened?
he tied his lace, nothing else.
yeah, but what were you doing?
i was marking the runners in the paper.
what are you doing?
just checking the time. carry on.
right, ollie, i want you to go outside, yeah, and shoot that boy in the face from the good family, all right?
anyone walks through that door except me, he blows the grenade.
- he tied his fucking lace... -i did tie my lace.
i bet, 100 to 1, you're fucking lying, mate. that's my money.
well, see, you've failed to consider the form.
i did blow up me own pub...
...for the insurance.
ok right... well, considering the form,
i would say 65 to 1. very good odds.
and i would be more than happy and agree if you were to sign over 65% of your business to me.
- thank you. -sixty-five? no deal.
- ollie, what do you say?
- jesus christ, alfie.
he tied his fucking lace, i saw him!
- mmm-hmm. -he planted a grenade, i know he did.
alfie, it's tommy fucking shelby...
you're behaving like a fucking child.
this is a man's world.
take your apron off, and sit in the corner like a little boy.
fuck off. now.
- four minutes. -all right, four minutes.
--talk to me about hand grenades.
the chalk mark on the barrel, at knee height.
it's a hamilton christmas.
i took out the pin and put it on the wire.
based on this...
...forty-five percent.
- thirty. -oh, fuck off, tommy.
that's far too little.
in france, mr solomons, while i was a tunneller, a clay-kicker.
i blew up schwaben hã¶he.
same kit i'm using today.
it's funny, that.
i do know the 179.
and i heard they all got buried.
three of us dug ourselves out.
like you're digging yourself out now?
like i'm digging now.
fuck me.
listen, i'll give you 35%.
that's your lot.
thirty-five.
- you're late. -hey, it's my business.
how the fuck did you get me out of that?
i need you today, brother.
i pulled some strings.
- you all right? -i am now.
so arthur's back in charge now?
he's in charge of you, and you're both in charge of him.
look-out duties only today.
- tom, i'm getting sick of this... -finn.
you don't obey orders, you don't come.
- johnny dogs. -tommy.
- your boys will meet us there?
- well, at least they'll be there,
captain.
- captain? -ah, we promoted you.
well, the boys decided you're no longer like a sergeant major.
fucking those rich women and using those fancy words.
i'd say you're more like a captain these days.
fine, well, i'll take it as a compliment.
just don't bloody shoot me.
let's go to the derby, boys.
all right, then! load 'em up!
hello.
no, i'm afraid mr shelby is in london.
- he can't be reached.
- no, he won't be back today.
he's at the races. the epsom races, the epsom derby.
can i ask who's calling?
i'm going to the station.
- what's that? -that money's yours.
you take the money, you get a train, you start a new life in london.
i don't want to see you here when i get back.
if i get back.
everything's an "if" in this birmingham life.
you can write on sundays and visit on holy days.
but i want you to wash this city out of your hair and your clothes.
it's what i should have done at the start.
now i've got business to attend to.
i do love you, michael.
i love you too.
you'll miss your train.
me beloved greyhounds.
behold.
today's rabbit.
when i give you the signal, i want you to send that man to his maker.
i decided to use you men because i couldn't trust the hearts and the livers of the english pansies and posies they'd given me as operatives.
right.
this is a man of some capability, but i expect no excuses and no failures.
the red right hand of the ulster volunteer force will not let you down, mr campbell.
the red right hand.
good luck, gentlemen.
gentlemen, today, we are not fucking about.
i hope you've all obeyed instructions and brought loaded firearms with you.
--very good.
you will all know that if you are lifted on a racetrack these days with a loaded weapon, you get 20 years.
that's all right. today, you won't get lifted.
because today, there will be no coppers around to lift you.
at exactly 3:00, there will be an incident in the owners' enclosure and all the coppers on the track will be diverted. all of them.
they will be looking for someone.
- so you will be free to operate at will. -looking for who?
me. they will be looking for me.
now, while the coppers are busy with me, you will make your move on sabini's pitches.
you will confiscate his takings, you'll destroy his licences, and you do it at gunpoint.
he usually has police protection, so they won't be armed.
we should aim to complete the takeover without a shot being fired, understood?
and remember, the licences are more important than the takings.
all right. before the fun begins, you can all lay 10 bob on nom de guerre.
- i hear she's going to win.
only beer beforehand, boys, and plenty of time for rum and whisky after.
and remember, do not make a move until 3:00.
when the coppers leave. that is all.
incident? what are you going to do that's going to make every copper at the derby look the other way?
trust me, brother.
ten, please.
she threw a shoe coming out of the box.
eh?
she looks in fine shape.
hello, hello, hello.
i missed you, buck. missed you, buck.
- should i be worried? -you should not.
go and drink, enjoy the day. i'll come and find you when the race is done.
hmm, that's nice. is that yours?
my mother wore it to the derby in 1895.
she was presented to queen victoria.
after the race, i'll change in the horse box and then come and join you up there with the toffs, what do you say?
hmm. yeah.
you don't want me to join you.
it's fine. i'll stay down here in the mud.
whatever happens today, it was good.
you mean, win or lose?
yeah. win or lose.
you know, i never watch the race. can't stand it.
i always like to find somewhere dark and quiet.
tommy?
if you can't find me up there,
i'll come and find you later.
what do you mean?
whatever happens, may, no regrets. no regrets.
and i will find you.
all right.
remember that.
bye.
put this on nom de guerre.
good day, sir.
there he is.
fucking meatball blokes.
right, let's go.
i have to talk to you.
- grace. what are you doing here? -i have to talk to you.
grace.
this is not a good time.
what's all this about? please excuse us.
whatever it is, grace, it'll have to wait.
it can't wait. it wasn't me who is at fault.
i'm pregnant.
the baby's yours.
better believe...
make your husband believe that it's his.
is that what you want me to do?
grace, i seriously have things to do.
it's not worth the toss of a coin this time?
grace, i have things to do. when they are...
when they are done, i will decide.
- when will that be? -after the race.
after the race? after the fucking race, tommy?
when the race is over i will decide what to do.
what to fucking do, all right?
but tommy... i was right not to tell him?
i could have phoned him and lied, but i didn't.
just tell me that i was right.
not to phone and lie. agree with that, tommy.
yes. yes, grace.
because the thing is...
...i love you, not him.
that is a thing.
a baby, thomas.
yes.
- go to your race. -where will you be?
i'll be waiting.
i'll wait where they lay their bets.
found a lost sheep.
come on, lizzie.
- what do you think? -about what?
- about the dress? -undo two buttons. come on!
oh tommy, i never thought i'd see the like of this.
yeah.
but i do know that i'm here to work, so you may have noticed i haven't taken a drink.
well, here.
take this. you might need it.
what's the work you want me to do here today, tommy?
is it taking notes in a meeting?
no, lizzie. you're not here to take notes.
my shorthand won't be required.
lizzie...
there's a man here and i need him separated from the crowd
-and taken to a quiet place. -a quiet place...
- lizzie, i know what i said. -yeah, you know.
you know, you told me i shouldn't do that kind of work any more.
i just need you to isolate him, is all.
no exceptions, you said.
i've drawn a map, all right, of where exactly you need to take him.
for months i made no exceptions because you told me not to.
lizzie... just keep him busy. i have the place marked with an "x" and i'll get to you before it can start, i promise. all right?
i mustn't smudge my eyes, he might not like that.
lizzie...
...this is the only time. after this, never again.
all right, i'll pay an extra five...
do not talk to me about money now.
not right now, i swear i'll break this glass in your eyes.
no exceptions, there's been no hardship.
you know why?
hmm?
doesn't matter.
who is he?
- to your right. soldier.
smoking a cigarette. just be alone with him at 3:00.
when the race starts, and i'll do the rest. yeah?
got a piece of chalk?
- chalk? -it's how the soldiers know.
it doesn't matter, just give me the fucking chalk.
lizzie, it's gonna be all right. eh?
i'll get to you, i promise. before it can start.
i will be there.
keep them fuckin' guns ready. keep them guns ready.
coppers aren't moving. stood there like fucking gargoyles.
keep your wits about you, boys, all right?
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the race will begin in four minutes.</i>
<i>so please make your way trackside.</i>
shouldn't you be busy?
when you've planned something well, there's no need to rush.
do you know something?
i actually trust you to do this.
do you think there might be some...
...measure of respect developing between us?
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>runners and riders are coming to order, please take your seats.</i>
old foes that have grown to admire each other, and see each other's professional virtues.
personally, i think not.
i think not.
well, i drink to that.
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please be upstanding for the national anthem.</i>
it's always the plan that you'll stay together forever.
or perhaps she'll whore for you, take her husband's money. is that the plan?
how wrong i was about her.
i was wrong about her as well.
you once said to me, that men like us can never be loved.
she loves me. she told me.
she loves me.
and all you got was a bullet and a fucking wolf head cane.
well. bully for you.
this i know.
ahead of you is damnation, but i have the love of god, and the certainty of salvation.
i know what you did to polly.
i know what happened to my uncle in jail.
today, it'll be me dead, or you, but whoever it is, gonna wake up in hell tomorrow.
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the runners and riders are under starter's orders.</i>
<i>- and they're off!</i>
come on girl, come on.
at least make a showing.
come on, tommy.
what a pretty dress.
take it off.
let's take this off first, shall we?
lift up your dress and show me that you're clean.
hmm.
do as you're told!
we should take it slow, we've got time.
- this area's closed off. -what?
the king will be coming this way after the race.
- this area is secure! -but i need to...
- you'll have to go round.
- get the fuck off!
- you bitch!
fuck off!
get the fuck off me!
- hey!
- russell!
fuck!
stop it!
- lizzie... -where were you?
- where the fuck were you?
- give me the gun, lizzie.
lizzie, lizzie.
- i'm sorry. -fuck off, fuck off!
just go.
go on, go!
officers. officers!
i was taking a shit and i heard voices, irish voices and i heard a shot.
i swear to god, there's a soldier lying dead in there.
get every man in uniform around the king.
every man in uniform around the king. right now!
the ira are on the course.
everyone to the king.
all right, my pretty boys. this is it.
right. ready. you get round the back.
come on. don't bunch.
right, you stay with us. i want you to stay back!
let's go!
put your hands in the air!
turn around!
is there a problem?
fenians on the course.
a soldier's been shot, someone said there was an irishman in here.
that is correct.
very sorry, sir.
check the security to his majesty.
i will now take your mind off the situation.
mr sabini, you're late. have a seat.
what happened to your nose?
you want to have that brother of yours put down.
oh, i tried that. he bit the vet.
i've told the coppers that you're a fucking gypsy racketeer peaky blinder.
they're coming. they're gonna throw you out.
before the king comes up here.
well, from what i saw the police are a bit busy right now.
did you win any money today, mr sabini?
where are the coppers?
said to that sergeant, "one minute", he said, "two", it's fucking ten!
like i told you, they're a bit busy. same as my boys.
- what the fuck does that mean? -what does that mean?
well, my boys are on the track.
they're having a little bonfire.
gaming licences, you know.
fuck!
you place too much reliance on the police for your security, mr sabini.
that was a mistake.
you're gonna now think about who you are, think about where you are.
you pull a weapon, you are the king's assassin.
now sit down, stay calm.
good.
now your next mistake, mr sabini, was breaking your promise with alfie solomons.
hmm. you promised alfie that his bookies could come to epsom.
he was very hurt when you said no.
he was very hurt.
that's why me and alfie are back in business.
hold it! hold it!
it's all right, it's all right, officers.
he's just a bad loser. what the fuck? hey!
you fucking lose, you fucking gypsy bastard!
you lose!
what the fuck are you looking at?
step back, move.
you're now a prisoner of the red right hand.
now, take his hat and gun.
get him up.
easy.
take a seat.
sit down!
that's it.
you make yourself nice and comfortable.
we're just going for a wee drive, mr shelby.
let's go.
i guessed and then john confirmed it.
guessed what?
who are you?
i'm may carleton .
i train tommy shelby's horse.
and you're the woman who he said was going to sail away.
i see he didn't tell you about me.
he did tell me about you, i wonder if that's significant.
tell me what about you?
do you have any idea where he is?
i'm waiting for him here.
there's been trouble on the track.
all the bookies have had their licences burnt.
shouldn't you be down with the horses?
which means they'll have to re-apply for their legal pitches.
it's all part of tommy's plan for the future.
what do you know about tommy's future?
the applications will be denied, of course.
then all the pitches will be allocated instead to tommy's bookies.
i know because i'll make sure of it.
i have influence with the board.
- there's business and there's love. -is there?
there's thomas shelby.
- what do you want from him? -same as you.
i want to feel alive.
did he tell you my name?
my name is grace.
in your statement to the house, sir,
i believe that you should say that witnesses heard the killer say that they were members of the ira and that the killing was in retribution for actions of the field marshal in county cork.
oh, our friend from birmingham?
he's been taken care of.
oh...
a very good day, sir.
- thank...
sorry, i must go.
goodbye.
polly.
tommy told me you'd be here.
and i told tommy it should be me who finishes you.
small and weak.
that's how you like it, isn't it?
well, this time small and weak has got a gun.
no, you wouldn't do that here.
no.
do you see any coppers?
well, i don't.
they're all around your precious king.
ah.
polly, polly...
- some part of you... -i have no parts.
some part of you wanted me as well.
i know that, i felt it.
and sure as hell some part of me wants you still.
and not just that part, but... some part of my soul.
some part of my soul.
curious how that is to me and curious that it should be you.
opposites perhaps.
opposite, and that...
that thing sticking in my heart, you own, you own part of that heart, you do.
you do, polly. you do.
don't fuck with the peaky blinders.
let's get you home.
come on.
look at this place, we own it!
put your money away before i take it off ya.
- fuckin' clean up! -get up!
lizzie, what the fuck are you doing here?
- working for tommy, same as all of us. -you work for the blinders.
- what happened to you?
- fell over.
oh, don't fuckin' give me that.
lizzie...
come here, come here. come here, come here.
--eh? were you working?
yeah?
thought you'd earn yourself a few bob at the races, eh?
it's gotta stop, lizzie.
it's gotta stop, tommy's already told you.
toffs at the races are the worst, you know that.
hey, come here, come here. look at me.
cheer up.
we won.
we fucking took epsom.
we kicked the cockneys' fucking arses.
congratu-fucking-lations.
we fucking beat them, all right.
john didn't even shoot his gun!
we're kings! kings of the fucking world!
john, i don't see the same thing in your eyes that i see in tommy's.
you should get out.
you should get out.
where is tommy, anyway?
any of you boys in france?
you know, i wouldn't mind a cigarette.
the somme.
black woods.
somme, the bulls.
smoke.
so fucking close.
so fucking close.
oh... and there's a woman.
yeah.
a woman...
...who i love...
...and i got close.
nearly got fucking everything!
oh, what the fuck?
get it done, boys.
comrade, we have our orders, you know how it is.
i know how it is.
in the bleak midwinter.
at some point in the near future,
mr churchill will want to speak to you in person, mr shelby.
he has a job for you.
we will be in touch.
get out of the grave, tinker.
be on your fucking way!
fuck!
right!
ladies and gentlemen, i'd like to raise a toast.
- to the small heath rifles.
- small heath rifles.
to the lane boys.
and to the peaky fucking blinders.
who's gonna stop us, eh?
nobody.
polly and i had a bet.
one of us bet you'd take the money and go.
and one of us bet you'd still be here.
she wants me to stay.
mmm, you know something, michael?
what polly wants will always be a mystery to me.
i've decided.
i want to make real money with you.
i've got some ideas, michael.
for the future of the company.
and also,
i'm planning on getting married.
