<i>oh, there's a woman.</i>
yeah.
a woman.
who i love.
and i got close.
in the bleak midwinter...
at some point in the near future,
mr churchill will want to speak to you in person.
mr shelby, he has a job for you.
we will be in touch.
oh, thank you.
i'm going to take him.
some of us know the words.
trot on.
trot on.
trot on.
here come the fucking cavalry. late as usual.
dearly beloved.
we are gathered here today to join together in holy matrimony
thomas michael shelby and grace helen burgess.
those flowers need to go there.
<i>do you, thomas michael shelby,</i> take grace helen burgess to be your lawful wedded wife?
<i>i do.</i>
do you, grace helen burgess, solemnly swear to love, honour,
<i>and obey till death do you part?</i>
<i>i do.</i>
<i>i now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>
get out of it!
go on, take the photograph!
tommy.
arthur, get the bastards in the house.
i will. i will. john! john-boy! get 'em in the house, all of 'em.
go on, all of you! back to the house! go on!
all right, pol. tell the lee girls i've counted all the paintings.
and, pol, some people here are not on the list.
curly, charlie. kitchen.
- time?
- five minutes.
actually, we were told on the train there'd be cocaine.
jeremiah, john-boy, kitchen, let's go.
i swear to god them fucking cavalry boys are asking for it.
uh, i was told to ask someone young. will there be cocaine?
sweetheart, i am young, informed and, uh, very well-equipped.
you chose your man wisely.
come on, kitchen now.
arthur, this lady wants to play in the snow.
no, no snow today. no snow today.
<i>kitchen, come on.</i>
i just wish tommy was here.
- where are they?
- i don't know, tommy.
- arthur, john, where are they?
- i don't know.
- i am telling you now, we got lost.
- come on.
you really need to do a map.
right, boys, you're all here.
today, this is my fucking wedding day.
yeah, and you said there'd be no bloody uniforms.
nevertheless... nevertheless, john...
despite the bad blood,
i'll have none of it on my carpet.
now for grace's sake, nothing will go wrong.
those bastards out there are her family.
and if you fuckers do anything to embarrass her, your kin, your cousins, your horses, your fucking kids, you do anything...
- tom?
- to... what?
what about snow?
yeah, their women are sports, i'll say that...
no. no. no.
no cocaine.
no cocaine. no sport.
no telling fortunes. no racing.
no fucking sucking petrol out of their fucking cars.
and, you, charlie, stop spinning yarns about me, eh?
i'm just trying to sell you to them, tom.
but the main thing is, you bunch of fuckers, despite the provocation from the cavalry, no fighting.
oi!
no fighting.
no fucking fighting.
no fighting.
no fucking fighting!
good.
get the fuck off me!
you're needed downstairs.
grace, you're needed downstairs.
people are hungry.
i was putting charles to sleep.
i'll come down, but not with you like this.
all right, fine.
tommy.
i thought today was the reason for the way you've been acting lately.
i know there's business on your mind.
- and i know there always will be.
- yeah.
look, i am sorry that they wore their uniforms.
yeah, they fucking did, eh. they fucking did.
but i can tell it's more than that.
you've been like this for weeks.
i need you to tell me that it's business making you like this.
and not regret over me.
say it out loud and i'll know if it's true.
it's business, grace.
and bad, bad business it is, all around.
and i'm scared, grace.
i'm scared for you.
i'm scared for the baby.
and this is how i am when i'm scared.
it is unfamiliar to you, but not to me.
i can... i can fucking be scared and carry on.
and it's not pleasant to look at and no joy to be around.
all right?
i'm sorry.
we just made vows to share everything.
tell me what it is you're afraid of.
stand up. stand up, stand up.
arthur's speech.
i'm scared of fucking arthur's speech.
all right?
me, too.
tommy, what are you doing?
tommy.
there's half the british army waiting for us downstairs.
they're king's irish. we waited two weeks in the mud for them.
tommy.
there are things, that if i take them off, i won't be able to put back on...
that's good.
hello, mrs shelby.
i'm sorry for being busy in my head.
now let's complete the ceremony.
hey, listen. listen, listen.
what do you call an animal with a prick halfway up its back?
a cavalry horse.
he got... he gets it.
fuck it. fuck it.
where the bloody hell are they?
you're best man, arthur. go and find them.
yeah.
that's completely nonsense.
you know, we're part of a serious political movement and organisation.
they're not "secret little meetings," they're just meetings.
we talk about the world, about the people in it, about our current political landscape and what's going on.
you know, we really need to re-evaluate the way our government...
- he's strange.
- he's looking over.
what?
he's coming. he bloody is.
fuck. it's the wrong one.
what do you mean "the wrong one"? how many are there?
there's two, giving me the eye.
i prefer the other one. he looks harmless.
it must be that bloody lipstick tommy brought you back from new york.
i couldn't help noticing you are unaccompanied.
i also am alone. may i join you?
- tommy?
- oh.
didn't see a thing. did not see a thing. sorry, brother.
i need you downstairs.
it's all right. we're done.
- you good?
- yeah.
- never been better.
- yeah?
- are you drunk?
- huh? no.
no.
here.
all right, it's just one drink, then.
linda's a good woman, arthur.
good whisky.
a good man needs to hold out sometimes, eh?
so, uh, do i mention this in my speech, then, eh?
not unless you want to get cut, arthur.
sorry, sister.
right. look.
tell the maids to break out the champagne.
we'll be down in a minute.
champagne, yeah. ok.
- i got it right here. i'm ready.
- good. good.
where are you from?
i'm a refugee.
from where?
russia.
in the past few months,
thomas has developed some business interests with russia.
i see he has confided in you.
hmm.
you need his permission to even speak to me.
my senior position within the shelby company means i don't often have to ask permission from anyone to do anything.
so perhaps you'll just tell me why the fuck you're talking russian business on thomas's wedding day.
hold on, wait a second. so you're saying i'm not allowed a man...
it's about your choice of man.
i'm not allowed a man on my arm?
thomas says that they're the rules.
fucking parish bastard!
michael, speeches. come on.
arthur. you know why he didn't come, don't you?
why who didn't come?
my bloody man.
oh, you mean the wop?
i just heard there was a fire at his restaurant midnight last night.
and a smashed back window and a smell of petrol.
lizzie, we tried to talk some sense into you.
we did checks on him.
he's had five different names in the last six years, and he's got connections with the naples boys.
come on, michael.
what do you know about love?
about when lightning strikes.
so, it was lightning, hmm? not petrol.
i thought you were off the whisky, arthur.
yeah, i am. having a couple now and again to remind myself why i don't drink it.
you set fire to his restaurant to stop him coming.
you have no right to choose who i step out with in my own time!
lizzie, you now have an important position in this company.
you got the order, same as us.
you can do it.
until further notice...
no fraternizing with the foreigners.
yeah, well, you can tell tommy from me all the girls in the office think he's losing his fucking mind!
to the bride.
the bride.
- the bride.
- the bride.
and now, according to tradition, my best man will say a few words.
go on! here he goes! go on, arthur!
i'd like to, erm... i'm not one for speeches.
- sing, then!
- i will later, john.
but, er... i do, er...
i do have some words written down here on this piece of paper.
this doesn't include everything that i want to say.
arthur, just, uh... just read what we wrote down, eh?
- i will. i will.
- mmm-hmm.
but...
first... first, uh, a few words from... from the heart.
um...
this man here, my brother tommy, helped me survive through some of the worst times.
it's a wedding, arthur, tell a joke.
yeah, tell a joke.
what i am trying to say is that...
my brother and the love of a good woman pulled me through that time.
now tommy also has the love of a good woman.
her name's grace.
like the grace of the good lord.
and even though the circumstances of their union was tragic...
all right. let's, uh... arthur.
let's raise a toast, eh?
to, uh...
to love, to peace, to marriage.
- and to marriage.
- to marriage.
well done, arthur, beautiful speech. really nice.
really, really nice.
where is he fucking going?
- i think i messed it up.
- no, not a bit.
- hmm.
- you spoke with such truth.
and god heard you.
can i have a word with my brother, please, linda?
- what he was going to say was beautiful.
- mmm-hmm.
alone, please.
all right. come here.
come here.
we talked about this, arthur.
that's why we wrote it all down.
most of grace's side don't even know her husband killed himself.
they think it was an accident.
- oh, i know.
- you know.
- yeah.
- yeah.
what do you think i am? hmm?
what do you think i am, tommy, eh?
- you think i'm a fucking idiot!
- all right, boys.
- come on, have a good night.
- you think i would say it...
- come on, then. that's it.
- you keep walking, you nosy bastards.
- arthur.
- you stay away from me.
- fuckin hell.
- you stay away from me. i've had enough.
ah!
shit.
yeah. yeah.
ah, shit.
three shots i've had. that's it.
- i know.
- i drew the line.
i know.
i know you've turned a corner, arthur.
- yeah.
- i know.
- yeah.
- mmm-hmm.
- i'm your best man.
- i know.
i wasn't going to tell no one.
it's all right.
it's done. get up. get up.
get up.
right.
the russians have made contact.
we have to get used to how these bastards operate.
for them, family is a weakness, and they go after them.
for me, family is my strength. and there's business to be done.
and i need you.
now, fuck speeches, fuck weddings.
you're my best man every fucking day.
- ok.
- yeah.
now go and get john, get him sobered up.
find johnny dogs.
it's the russians through the smoke tonight.
all right.
good.
and, arthur?
in future, it's not always right to listen to linda.
- yeah? yeah.
- yeah.
it's full of gypsies and blacks.
grace says he exports automobiles to the colonies.
pol, now.
so what does he say?
he won't meet you unless you give us the name.
what name?
we were told to ask for a code name when contact was made.
constantine. the code is constantine.
tommy said no racing, no gambling.
yeah, he's changed his mind.
- right. don't worry, finn, ok?
- right.
cavalry boys ride like a sack of stones, all right?
john. john, there's an awful lot of king's shillings around here today.
now, out of loyalty to the regiment, they'll all be putting their money on this bad boy that i filled up with morphine and water.
here. tommy's all right if i, uh, do the book, is he?
he said betting's ok, but all proceeds go to the shelby foundation charity.
oh, is this charity of his for real, then?
he says he wants to be seen giving back to the poor of birmingham.
so that'll be me, john.
myself. if i can't earn a shilling here tonight.
huh?
they'll make him the fucking lord mayor next.
mmm, that's the idea, charlie-boy.
fucking hell.
right, all you lot make as much noise and fuss as you can.
especially fucking you.
so we're a fucking distraction, john, is it?
huh?
tommy is doing business on a night he should be just fucking.
right, place your bets with me.
your favourites. your favourites.
come on, boys.
'cause i hope my boy finn doesn't fall off that fucking horse.
come on.
for charity.
shut up.
oh, you found it.
we nearly gave up.
did he tell you what my business with him is?
the same shit the turks used to smoke.
i wonder, why does he trust his aunt more than his brothers?
go and watch the race, boys.
the turk's clean.
i am russian.
same fucking thing.
so you make contact on my wedding day.
you now have very powerful enemies.
at the soviet embassy and within your own government.
you are being watched, at your house, your office, your clubs, your bars.
you best be quick or i'll be missed. where's the money?
the duke's niece is bringing it from london.
i was told money on contact.
ten thousand in us dollars.
my employer only trusts members of his family with cash.
she will be at snow hill station at 10:00.
a woman alone in birmingham with $10,000 in cash.
- and she also has a revolver.
- oh, i see.
i thought you trusted women.
i don't trust birmingham.
i'll have her picked up.
- by who?
- by the police, pal.
this is our city.
fucking beautiful horse, tom.
beautiful.
- he's a natural, that boy.
- yeah.
good posture. rides like dad.
all right, listen to me.
tell johnny dogs and his boys to light a fire in the woods, a big one, to take meat.
and send finn to watch the gates.
moss is bringing someone.
you don't?
i just needed to bring you somewhere nobody could see.
but your friend gave this to me. he said you all did it.
not me.
but it's all right. go on.
i see you don't, either.
- don't be silly, everyone does.
- so go on, then.
- cut the snow.
- we call it tokyo.
we call it whatever the customer calls it.
in london, we were told you are all gangsters.
so that's why you got on the train to dirty, old birmingham.
for a dirty, old night.
you don't look like the others.
that's the idea.
i put it all together, but i don't partake.
you see, i've got a bright future, you see.
mapped out.
but you want me to be like them, don't you?
there's a cavalry officer stationed in ceylon.
and when his tour of duty ends in march, we'll be engaged.
so i have a bright future, too.
mapped out.
but you want to try things first.
no. keep it.
as if i were a whore.
well, if that's the game you want to play.
polly.
hello, grace.
you look absolutely beautiful.
welcome to the family.
oh, i see. tommy's orders.
no upsets tonight.
your hair, everything, beautiful.
do you know where he is?
yes. yes, i do.
you know, tommy really wants to keep certain things a secret from me.
it's very hard when you're man and wife.
we were late coming down because we were having sex.
so afterwards, he told me everything.
royalist russians buying weapons to fight the bolsheviks in georgia.
a lost cause, tommy says.
and churchill, he's the go-between.
but it's against government policy so everything must be kept a secret.
you know it's begun?
they started the business tonight?
no.
i didn't.
but you just told me.
so, thank you.
let's not forget i used to do this for a living.
oh, i haven't forgotten, sweetheart.
it's only thomas that's forgotten what you are.
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>the bride and the groom will now dance alone.</i>
polly just told me there is business being done.
i didn't ask them to come.
tommy, please don't let anything happen tonight.
just get this business done and get away from things like this.
i'll run the foundation, you run the tracks and sell cars.
promise me.
hmm?
a wedding vow.
i promise.
no guns in the house and charles will never see one.
i love you, thomas shelby.
you keep us safe.
i love you.
and i promise i will make us safe.
<i>ladies and gentlemen, you may now join.</i>
gate house, come on.
tommy, arthur, collins.
may i introduce you to the grand duchess tatiana petrovna, from tbilisi, georgia.
grand duchess, may i introduce you to the shelby brothers.
small heath, birmingham.
and, uh, good luck with this one, tom.
give me the money.
i was told to give it to mr kaledin.
whoever it is up there, he gave the wrong name.
we asked him the name and he gave the wrong one.
- what name did he give?
- no.
i don't trust any of you.
now you give me the money.
i know mr kaledin by sight from tbilisi. is his hair dark?
the instructions i was given was anyone using the wrong code name was an infiltrator for the soviet embassy.
just let me go to the house.
i do not want this shit anywhere near my fucking house.
all i know is "no variations."
that's from churchill himself.
whoever it is up at the house, he gave the wrong fucking name.
and you do this to me on my fucking wedding day.
the money is in the car, mr shelby.
fetch it out and count it.
good. finn.
yeah. we're good.
you can go. moss...
can you do it?
can you kill?
moss, you take the "duchess" back to birmingham.
righto tom.
come on, love.
that's right.
you have got to tell me the reason, otherwise i'll never be able to trust you.
the truth is, that i slept with the wife of one of the colonels who sat for me.
but that was 12 years ago.
and the aristocracy don't believe in forgiveness.
neither do the shelbys.
so, we kill him?
he's a red.
we're being paid by the whites. it's part of the contract.
contract.
we should never have got into this, tom.
there was no choice.
"a factory break-in," that's what you said.
yeah. and that's what it is.
there's just some shit that goes with it.
and who shovels it? hmm?
who fucking shovels it? eh?
i fucking know.
- arthur?
- i fucking know.
arthur.
there's 10 times where that's coming from, 10 times.
for lifting vehicles off a fucking shop floor.
vehicles, tommy. fucking vehicles.
- nothing about tanks.
arthur, you listen to me. you listen to me, all right?
there are powerful people in this country who want to help these mad bastards, including the king, churchill and half the fucking tory party.
and if we refuse, arthur, if we fucking refuse, they will see to it that we hang for one of our many sins.
now, we've never earned money like this. never.
we'll use it to buy the wharf at boston docks.
that's why i've asked for dollars.
and when it's done, it's business as usual.
come on, brother. it's my wedding night.
- where's john?
- looking for esme.
right.
ruben oliver, portrait artist.
i really enjoyed the depiction of you in the dining room.
nice to meet you, mr oliver.
johnny, ragtime.
so, where were we?
- crimea.
- oh, i mean before i bored you with war.
- politics.
- ah, yes.
you're the only one in your family who is a communist?
some of them are, they just don't know it.
and you are a very close family, yes?
mmm, always within punching distance.
what does that mean?
it means, "yeah, we're a close family."
arthur?
i do apologise for the interruption.
there is a woman here to see you, mr kaledin.
she just arrived.
so, tatiana made it from london safe?
- yes.
- where is she?
out by the stables.
can i use the lavatory?
you can piss outside by the stables.
no!
very sensible idea, mr shelby.
clear the air away from the ladies.
we are rather like generals here, aren't we?
watching our men do battle.
we are a bit too close to the fighting to be generals, surely.
you know, mr shelby, some of us only agreed to come today to bless this union because of your exemplary war record.
but as grace's uncle and a kind of father to her for many years,
i'm still deeply uneasy about the many stories of corruption and violence.
drink the fucking wine and smile.
that's what i'm doing.
oh, you got me good.
oh, you fucking bastard.
no foul!
no foul!
don't shoot.
no!
oh, for the love of god, don't shoot.
no! no!
- no!
- for the love of god...
- no! no! no!
- for the love of god...
- no!
- for the love of god.
what was that?
it's probably just a car back-firing.
it wasn't the day i was expecting.
nor me.
it's over now.
tomorrow it'll be just us.
come here.
go on. you've had a great night.
the water froze in my car.
uh, they said i could stay.
i know, this is preposterous.
plenty of other rooms to stay in.
- goodnight, mr oliver.
- you have my card.
anytime you're in london, we could have tea.
i went looking for you.
i thought you'd be in here.
i knew it.
i wanted to end with a bit of peace.
yeah.
look what i found.
it's beautiful. thanks.
arthur, you mustn't worry about what happened with the speech.
what was in your heart was beautiful.
god hears all the speeches that don't get said.
and isn't it nice to still be yourself at this time of night?
close your eyes, arthur, and spend a minute thinking about that.
it's all right.
it's all right.
more money than all those fucking toffs put together, eh?
and you're willing to gamble it all on one robbery.
i'm a gambling man, pol.
<i>thomas michael shelby...</i>
<i>today is my wedding day.</i>
take the photograph!
<i>- the russians have made contact.</i> <i>- on your wedding night.</i>
whoever it is up there, he gave the wrong name.
can you do it? can you kill?
you know why he didn't come, don't you?
my bloody man.
there was a fire at his restaurant.
no fraternizing with the foreigners.
there's a cavalry officer.
in march, we'll be engaged.
<i>but you want to try things first.</i>
<i>i'm ruben oliver, portrait artist.</i>
you have my card.
what was in your heart was beautiful. just get this business done and get away from things like this.
promise me.
i promise.
i will make us safe.
your brothers came to my house.
they said the peaky blinders had business with me.
you're not afraid of me.
so, what is it you want from a simple working man?
fear.
poor mr nutley drank too much.
he went for a piss on the train tracks that run behind the factory.
train came.
they found his body in saltley broken into bits.
i know what you do.
tell me what you want.
there.
the let's complete warehouse. bays 4, 5 and 6.
you have the keys?
yes, i have keys.
what's in bay 4?
completed type 40s and type 21 <i>s</i> waiting for the paint shop.
bay 5?
- paint shop and parts.
- uh-huh.
so, it's bay 6.
what is?
give me the keys to bay 6.
it's just old stock in storage.
give me the keys to bay 6.
for your trouble.
give it to your charity.
i'm only doing this for the safety of my family.
so, will it be just boys in your charitable institution or girls as well?
both.
you must divide them.
you know how the little creatures can get.
where are your people? you said they'd be here by 5:00.
they are a law unto themselves.
you can never quite grasp who they are.
like gripping wet soap-
i've done my research.
erm...
perhaps you know them as the, uh, economic league.
only once did i get a letter from them headed "the vigilance committee."
which tips the hand a little.
no.
the name i've heard is section d.
that's what special branch calls them.
business men, mps, army officers.
yes, it will be fun to bring such men to a gypsy scrapyard.
you asked for privacy.
since the election, the government has decided that we are the enemy.
when all we're trying to do is save the country from revolution.
are you political, mr shelby?
because these odd fellows believe that the time is coming soon when everyone must choose a side.
are your people coming or are they not coming?
mr shelby, you will learn that these men are far too grand for the clock to govern them.
you'll get used to meeting in the small hours of the morning.
they're like monks.
so, when is your charitable institute opening?
when i fucking say.
well, i'll stop by from time to time to hear confession from the little creatures.
you'll meet mr patrick jarvis, mp.
he'll probably want to become a trustee.
it's just his thing, to drop by in the evenings after a few drinks.
we'll make it a formal arrangement as part of the bigger deal between us.
i will have an office there.
ah!
my god. some devil gets into you, doesn't it, boy?
mr shelby, if i want to play the squire in your place of false charity, then i will.
ambition for respectability doesn't make you a saint.
am i wrong?
oh, lord. that's 6:00, is it?
well, i wish you a good day.
where the fuck are you going?
did i not make it clear?
they said if they weren't here by morning prayers then the meeting has been cancelled.
perhaps mr jarvis has been held up at the house of commons.
perhaps admiral hall's been held up at the house of lords.
am i impressing you?
or perhaps they have decided they don't care for doing business with gypsies in scrap metal yards which would be a poor outcome for you.
you give them a message from me, priest.
you tell them i've been to the factories and the armoured vehicles are in good condition.
how many?
twenty-seven.
and the foreman is ours.
this is someone you'll meet.
today, at the ritz.
i have meetings today.
you have one meeting, this one.
in london.
so, you'd best catch the milk train.
cold.
my apologies, sir.
and how many times i asked you to tell them about sending us the servant's crockery.
i have no control over the choice of service, sir.
hmm, and what about yesterday's eggs and last year's fish and last century's tea leaves in a cracked pot.
sir, i have a list of today's social engagements, if you'd like to hear them.
oh, are we in a rush today?
- i have duties at the main house, sir.
- mmm.
luncheon at the ritz with duke michail michailovich.
cancelled.
- what reason?
- he says he is unwell, sir.
you are due to have tea at 3:00 with prince sevlod ianovich and lady mary lewington, sir.
mmm! good.
i miss out on the bore and meet the beauty.
however, in the absence of the duke, the, er, prince and the lady too have cancelled, sir.
other than that, your day is, er, your own.
you do have one business appointment to discuss automobiles with a mr thomas shelby, sir.
you asked for a meeting out in the open.
fresh air and the fine aroma of shit.
"neutral ground", you said.
this is hardly neutral ground.
well, it's what you've got.
<i>so, por favor,</i> sit down.
- where is thomas?
- he got called away.
he'd said he'd be here.
yeah, he is busy.
and i just told you he got called away. what do you want?
there has been a peace between the peaky blinders and the changretta family for two years now...
do you want some tea or not?
here, finn, pour the italians some english tea. go on.
we don't want fucking tea.
we want an explanation.
well, i'll have fucking tea.
explanation for what?
the little venice restaurant on forge street was burnt down.
no. no. couldn't have been us, we was at a wedding.
you burnt it down to stop my son being at that same wedding.
he wasn't missed.
you are such big boys now.
but once you borrowed clothes from us to look like men.
how's the tea, arthur? is it...
it's cold.
please tell tommy that we pay him whatever he asks us to pay.
we stay out of the city and off the tracks.
but you tell him from me that my son will walk with any woman in this city.
any woman he chooses.
even if that woman works for the emperor, thomas shelby.
my son is in love...
sorry. do excuse me.
carry on.
and if he wishes, he will walk with the woman he loves.
ok.
you know...
it would be hard for your son to walk anywhere with a bullet in each knee, wouldn't it?
too much.
you said too much, my friend.
sabini says, "suck and swallow." but no.
too much.
i spit.
oh. ok. a bit strong.
- fucking hell.
- isiah.
put two extra men on our pubs in nechells.
what are you talking about, arthur?
we're not scared of fucking eyeties any more.
don't tell tommy about the chair and clean this fucking shit up.
we're not scared of fucking wops!
all right, john.
arthur!
hello, ada.
tommy shelby? in a library?
i need to borrow a book about the russian revolution.
have you got a new wharf at maida vale now?
i've got a new wharf everywhere now.
sometimes, i see our trucks driving past.
"our" trucks?
shelby trucks.
why the interest?
i just want to broaden my mind.
well, this is a list of the bastards who ran away.
and this is written from the point of view of the peoples' struggle.
uh-huh.
there was a russian at your wedding.
he wouldn't tell me how come he got invited.
well, sometimes, exiled russian aristocrats get invited to social occasions to add a bit of class.
is that why he was there?
why do you want to know?
he was nice. maybe i'd like to see him again.
would that be possible?
no. that would not be possible.
what business do you have with the russians, tommy?
can i rip this page out?
no, you cannot rip that page out.
property of the people.
tommy, when arthur took the russian away, he had his killing pistol under his jacket.
and then johnny lit a fire in the woods.
you want all the details because you're bored, ada.
you used to chase rats with a revolver, ada.
for fuck's sake.
i might just have a job for you after all.
did we run kempton yesterday or not?
danny lee got drunk.
instead of injecting the horses with cocaine, he decided to share it with his cousins.
jesus christ.
he's your brother-in-law.
tell esme to speak to him about it.
look. before i start...
i don't want you to do anything about this.
about what?
vicente changretta's son.
- the one lizzie was stepping out with...
- what, angel?
he's no bigger than twopence worth of change.
well, he heard you threatened him directly to shoot him in the knees.
and now he's going around nechells telling everybody he's going to kill you.
this is lizzie's fault to start with, tommy's for leaving it up to you.
what are you talking about?
we run london.
we run the north, we run the whole fucking country.
what do we care about some fucking nechells green eyeties?
we don't need to be getting involved in all these little piss pots.
what does arthur say?
that's why i'm here and not him.
if he said it, there'd be a fight.
he says,
"apologise."
he fucking said what?
we own the city.
but we don't need to rub everybody's noses in it.
if the old man decides to make a stand, he might get sabini feeling sentimental...
sabini's done.
they're all done.
and they all pay up.
but we don't want rebellions.
what does, erm, tommy say?
tommy's busy. he left me in charge.
and what do you say?
- compromise.
- mmm-hmm.
i've asked lizzie to do it for you.
she's going to meet him, break up with him for good, apologise for any inconvenience, say it was all her fault...
for fuck's sake!
you know what all this is?
this is arthur's fucking missus.
turn the other fucking cheek?
we'll be handing out bibles in the fucking bull ring with her cousins.
john, you don't have to do anything. lizzie will do it for you.
then it'll all calm down and nobody will lose face.
i'll take his fucking face. how about that?
john, do nothing...
i believe you have a reservation for a private room in the name of mr romanov.
you work for mr romanov?
- yes.
- for his household or his office?
is there a problem?
i'm afraid without the presence of the duke mikhail michailovich or lady lewington, we shall have to ask for payment in advance.
can i ask why?
already, mr romanov has four outstanding bills with us.
one for accommodation and three for dining.
and two banquets, which we wrote off.
we've been asked to be understanding of our russian friends by his majesty.
but it has been some time now...
- may i ask your name, sir?
- shelby.
thomas shelby, and in the future i will be dining here quite a bit.
then i shall put you on our special list.
you do that.
here is a menu.
i recommend the teal and the pork.
although your guest, i'm sure, will order the caviar.
myself and my wife and my niece travelled by train, then coach, then on foot through the villa ai-todor in crimea.
on that journey i lost a toe.
i don't know, i woke up one morning and it was gone.
all of a sudden i saw a dog, and it was eating it.
they said the british had taken pity on us, and we were taken aboard <i>hms marlborough.</i>
i immediately kissed the steel deck, my lips froze to it.
and then, of course, i thanked god and your king for saving us.
though since then, he has done nothing but humiliate me.
who? god or the king?
sometimes both, mr shelby.
mmm, so, you met my niece already?
tatiana.
are you in love with her yet, hmm?
you would be wise not to love russian women, you know.
ah, better not speak of russian women.
mmm... that is the worst thing about being here.
russian women, they know how to hold it and most important, they know exactly when to let it go.
your cock, i mean.
english women, they do not know so much. you know?
did he die well, the spy?
he begged for his life.
i heard you had your brother do it.
so you trust your family, like me.
like us, mr shelby.
let's talk about trust then, shall we?
you are not a direct relation to the romanovs, you are georgian.
and the palace where you live in hampton court is, in fact, a grace and favour house donated to you, rent-free by the british crown.
the maître d' here, tells me that you are in some debt.
both here and other places, i imagine.
see, i've been given 10, but i've been promised 40.
already, i have had to have a man killed.
that sort of work does not come cheap.
do you understand?
let me tell you something, mr shelby.
before we boarded the ship, my niece sewed 16 diamonds into her velvet dress, and also she had two sapphires in her intimate places.
my wife managed two sapphires and five diamonds.
this is already for the killing of the spy and a down payment on future services.
now, tell me, where do you keep these things?
in a bank?
how could we plead poverty around london society if we used banks, mr shelby?
well, you should know...
hatton gardens is not safe.
that's why we have our own treasury.
very well, i shall have my people check its veracity.
before the revolution began, we were soft and weak.
we made compromise.
but let me tell you.
we will never be soft and weak again.
do you understand?
good day, mr shelby.
this way, mr changretta. just there, sir. there.
are you going to kill me?
get fucking up.
stay away from lizzie!
by order of the peaky fucking blinders!
going to introduce me, michael?
this is charlotte murray. her father makes cars.
i really enjoyed your wedding, mr shelby.
polly said that you should call her. there's been some trouble.
what trouble?
i'm guessing it's stuff she doesn't like to tell me about.
nice to meet you.
all right, finn. thanks for coming. fuck off.
finn, you can stay.
sit down, john.
sit down.
john, you cut angel changretta.
even though arthur told you to apologise.
mmm-hmm.
- polly told you to compromise. mmm-hmm.
you chose not to listen to mr apologise or mrs compromise.
and now i have got an italian walking around my backyard saying he's going to kill my brother.
so what do we do, john. do we apologise or do we compromise?
oh, it was just something john said as a joke.
yeah, but he's your brother as well, arthur.
yeah.
i know i didn't want to start a war over something john said without meaning it.
so, should he apologise in italian or in english?
or should we ask them which fucking language they prefer?
i'm not clear.
you said while this business was going on in london, you wanted peace at home.
and the only way to guarantee peace is by making the prospect of war seem hopeless.
if you apologise once, you do it again and again and again.
like taking bricks out of the wall of your fucking house.
do you want to bring the house down, arthur?
if you're soft on rebellion, it'll grow.
bloody "soft on rebellion".
you did the right thing, john.
now, we go on the offensive.
we take two of the changretta pubs, and we take them tonight. that's it.
oh! right. for christ's sake, why?
- hey.
- why?
why? because we fucking can.
because we fucking can and if we can, we do.
and if we lift our heel off their necks now, they’ll just come at us.
remember these are the bastards that wanted danny whizz-bang dead.
you're getting soft, brother.
soft and weak.
save the bible for sundays, eh.
finn?
i need to get to hockley and then home.
it's been a long day.
you take the wrexham, you take the five bells.
you get them signed over to us in the morning.
you make sure the coppers stay away.
don't use the fucking phones, all right? there's someone listening.
well done.
hmm.
not hungry, mrs shelby?
"hungry"? oh, no. sorry, mary.
you'll ruin your eyes.
tommy...
- hello.
- hello.
sit down.
- guess.
- guess what?
- he said yes.
- who?
the leader of the birmingham city council is going to attend the dinner.
- everyone has said yes. everyone.
- ah.
i keep having to change the catering.
and my writing hand is almost falling off.
oh, what are you writing for? i bought you a typewriter.
you don't write letters of a social occasion on a typewriter.
oh. forgive me.
i have the drawings of what they plan to do with the grounds of the house.
there'll be an area for the children to play. look.
mmm-hmm.
and the birmingham charity commission have agreed to set aside their three rotten floorboards upstairs and grant us the licence within a month.
- you're not listening to me.
- yes i am. i am.
do you think i'm becoming obsessed?
yes.
should i ask you how your day was, like a good wife?
no.
i'm guessing that means your day was not as successful as mine, hmm.
that all depends on how you measure success.
see, personally,
i measure it in sapphires.
oh!
- sapphires. mmm.
- uh-huh.
close your eyes.
close your eyes.
all right, you can open 'em.
where the hell did you get that?
it's beautiful.
you can wear it to the foundation dinner.
don't you think it's a bit much for a charity dinner?
grace, this is fucking birmingham.
"good taste" is for people who can't afford sapphires.
oh, mr shelby.
did you wind the clock, arthur?
we should go to bed.
i need to...
i need to go out.
some business i need to do.
"business"?
but you only just got in.
i won't be long.
it's 10 o'clock.
it's pouring with rain.
i'll go...
i'll go and i'll come back.
arthur.
working in the dark is for the devil.
we said.
start to do your work in the light.
your own light.
inside your head.
it's just paperwork.
i need you to clear your men out of nechells tonight.
i thought you boys were a bit grand for this sort of thing these days.
moss.
mind you, i think tommy enjoys the sport.
something like that.
good night, arthur.
night.
arthur, what are you doing?
arthur?
we're going to the garrison.
no. i'm going home, john.
go and fuck yourself, arthur.
yeah! fuck off!
- come here, charlie.
- charlie.
this big man and his brother are going to make us a lot of money.
or lose us a lot of money.
who the hell cares when they are such beautiful beasts, eh?
go on.
- you've got a house, john.
- oh, fuck.
full of kids.
well, you've got a maid to look after the kids.
yeah, she listens.
have you done the odds for tomorrow?
something urgent came up.
they get worse when they're pregnant, tom.
john.
esme, i need you to leave now. go out the back door, and lock it after you.
come on, i left the office.
there's two trucks full of coppers out there, john.
where the fuck is arthur?
he goes home to the madonna of moseley on the stroke of five.
- you need to talk to him, tom.
- esme, please, go. now.
please.
this is very fucking unusual.
so, call moss.
they're from out of town. london, by the looks of their boots.
since when are we scared of coppers, tom?
since things changed, john.
- scotland yard!
- get down! police!
- go on!
- john!
john! john, it's the yard.
put it down.
putting it down. putting it fucking down.
- hands on your heads!
- down on your knees! now!
let her fucking go! she's fucking pregnant.
leave her alone.
what the fuck is happening, tom?
let's go.
put me down!
- tell polly it's russian business, john.
- all right.
peaky fucking blinders my arse.
- is he afraid?
- no.
go on.
sit.
i'm talking to you, mr shelby.
so, the odd fellows want you to know that any deviation from your instructions will have consequences.
what's your dog's name?
you visited your sister.
eh? what's your name, boy?
your sister is a potential security breach.
she has connections with the bolsheviks in london who have connections with the soviet embassy.
i think i will just call your dog, "boy".
you love your boy, don't you?
understand this.
you have the local police in your pocket, we have scotland yard.
they do what we tell them just as surely as this dog.
let him off the leash.
are you hearing me, mr shelby?
i can charm dogs.
gypsy witchcraft.
and those i can't charm, i can kill with my own hands.
you learn it when you have a dog on a boat.
they go fucking mad in tunnels.
i feel like i'm in a tunnel now.
you know that feeling, when you have to kill or be killed?
let the dog off the leash and give the order you give in gaelic...
like i'm told you do when someone displeases you or someone reports you.
visit your sister again and she will die crossing the road.
then you say it.
if you wanted me dead, i would be dead, wouldn't i?
it's true.
it's true, we do need you alive.
but when you go home today, mr shelby...
be sure to check under your little boy's pillow.
the tooth fairy has been.
we can reach anyone.
anywhere.
- is everything all right?
- yes.
everything's fine. everything's fine.
yeah.
you promised, tommy.
i trust you.
- i trust you, tommy.
- yes.
he's fine. he's fine.
grace. grace.
come on.
you're not one of those impressionists, are you?
they're all terribly political, aren't they?
- and you're not?
- goodness no.
the people i work for just want me to paint what is there.
to me, politics is deliberately making things better for some people by deliberately making them worse for others.
well, i thought i might wear this.
oh, god. it's too much. i'll try something more simple.
no. don't...
suddenly, i feel incompetent.
i want the portrait to hang in the office, so i want it to look formal.
it's not formal.
it's beautiful.
it was made in paris.
it was stolen in birmingham.
my mother stole it from a house she was cleaning. 1901.
no. no.
it's yours. it belongs on you.
a woman of substance and class.
believe me. i've painted many women who don't belong in their expensive dresses.
there'll be no charge.
your normal rate.
- i insist.
- hmm! there's a first.
- so, when shall we start?
- i've already started.
come to my studio this evening.
- uh, i am busy this evening.
- polly, invite him.
invite me to what?
ada, this is a professional transaction.
- invite me to what?
- shelby foundation dinner.
- polly's going alone. you're invited...
- ada.
i'll come to your studio on sunday.
and then we shall begin.
a woman of substance...
...and class.
- thank you.
- you're welcome.
hello.
hello, polly.
tommy.
here's the leader of the birmingham city council.
- hello, tommy.
- hi, danny.
how's business?
all right, it's holding up, holding up. how are you?
you know each other?
i have interests in a steelworks in cradley heath.
tommy helps me get my products to the carmakers.
congratulations, mrs shelby, on your wedding.
thank you, i'm surprised you weren't invited.
now, how would that look, eh?
oh, now, the party has really started.
who are they?
father john hughes from st mary's boys reformatory.
and with him is mr patrick jarvis, mp.
they are part of an organisation called the economic league.
did you invite them, grace?
their names sound familiar.
they were recommended by the lord mayor.
oh. on your "best people of the city" list, eh?
- do you know them?
- i'll introduce you, tommy.
that's all right, danny. i'll introduce myself.
we appear to have taken you by surprise.
i have adjusted.
since the socialists got into downing street we are all being followed.
we have to meet in places where we'd meet anyway.
you should have stopped by small heath.
i could have given you a more traditional welcome.
- they want to know about ammunition.
- and chains for the wheels.
when the white guard make their run for tbilisi, it will be over rough terrain.
the chains are suitable for snow or wet ground.
they're already stored on the vehicles.
there's a batch of weapons set aside at the bsa, which is bound for the turkish army.
and how will you get it all aboard the london train?
there will be a strike that night across the city.
you will have to stop the train twice. how?
two drivers will join the strike at different points.
rather fun, getting the communist unions to help get weapons to the whites.
yes, rather fun, eh?
i am thinking ahead, thinking of every possibility, remembering everything that is happening.
the russians want to inspect the vehicles.
- i'll take photographs. mmm-mmm.
the duke has sent his niece, she's here.
tomorrow you will take her to the factory and show her.
no. union conveners are watching the factories.
not possible.
anything is possible, mr shelby.
you will take her.
you will pick her up from this hotel at ten.
now, look, a priest with an empty glass.
let's get back to the party.
you know, gentlemen, there is hell and there is another place below hell.
i will remember everything...
and forget nothing.
tommy, this is duchess tatiana petrovna.
come on, tommy, aren't you impressed to meet a real duchess?
well, i understand they charge a fee.
mr shelby, you are very direct.
too direct.
but it's true.
i attend these things for the champagne.
and for the chance to be treated like a duchess again.
you should have kissed my hand, mr shelby.
forgive me.
she was asking about my sapphire.
- i thought i recognised it.
- she said it was russian.
my husband has business in russia. perhaps you know about it, tatiana?
well, tonight is not a night for business, eh?
is that why you were in the concert hall for 10 minutes?
i think people are ready for dinner now, grace.
no, no. i'm not done pumping people for money.
what is "pump for money"?
it's what i do every day.
you know each other, do you?
you see, i am in charge of compiling the list of guests, but it's my husband who seems to know all of them.
i hear he is very well connected.
and where does a duchess hear that?
in certain circles.
all right, enough. ada.
grace, there's a lady dowager who wants to speak to you about coffee mornings.
she mentioned a £2,000 cash donation.
tatiana, you and i will speak later.
i would like that.
going to the factory tomorrow is a mistake.
nevertheless, we will go.
also, my uncle ordered me to seduce you to give us an advantage.
but with a beautiful wife like that it will be difficult, no?
tomorrow is a mistake.
have you not heard? we have no morals, we russians.
and no fucking sense.
and no options.
i would fuck you for the cause. what do you think of that?
i think you should not drink vodka with champagne.
does your wife know that the sapphire she is wearing has been cursed by a gypsy?
what did you say?
nothing on earth would make me wear it.
grace, listen to me. look, i can explain.
- go away.
- it's...
ladies and gentlemen.
for once, you shouldn't have to explain.
the loyalty toast, to his majesty the king.
to the king.
dinner is served.
you look beautiful, but you need to take this off.
why? because you think it would look better on her?
grace, look at me, fuck these people, eh.
fuck 'em, i need you to be all right.
i need you, grace. i need you.
damn you, tommy shelby.
- shall we go inside?
- yeah.
for angel!
get me a fucking ambulance now!
<i>until further notice, no fraternising with the foreigners.</i>
my son will walk with any woman in this city.
it would be hard for your son to walk anywhere with a bullet in each knee.
you said you wanted peace at home.
now, we go on the offensive.
<i>a woman of substance and class.</i>
and i've painted many women.
there'll be no charge.
the name i've heard is section d.
mps, army officers...
when all we're trying to do is save the country from revolution.
this is for the killing of the spy and a down payment on future services.
does your wife know that the sapphire she is wearing has been cursed?
nothing on earth would make me wear it.
for angel!
he's back.
was he out there all night?
every night since the funeral.
comes back in the morning to see charles and feed the horses, and when it gets dark, he goes off again.
he used to sleep out when he was a kid.
curly would find him in the pasture.
how's the baby?
he asks for him mum at night.
tommy made a list.
he wants to see you two first.
what about john and arthur?
how are the books?
unaffected.
up slightly.
there's also been a threefold increase in donations to the shelby foundation charity.
the counsellor suggested naming the new school "the grace shelby institute."
tell the counsellor the name "grace shelby institute" is acceptable to us.
this is a list on the other things i want doing.
that's all.
- tommy.
- that's all, pol.
well done, both of you.
right, let's go.
uh, we've already seen him.
he wanted to see people in a particular order.
i can normally read him, but he's difficult to read, so be careful.
i thought it was a fucking family meeting.
all of us together, i thought.
john, he's grieving.
to see everyone together would be too much.
yeah, well... come on, john.
arthur, we need him back.
sabini and solomons have already sent condolences and flowers, so it won't be long before they come trotting up the a1 like wolves.
go on. there's a timetable.
only good news.
there is only good news, polly.
who we fucking now?
well, there he is.
hi, tom.
hello, boys.
we, uh, didn't get a chance to see you after the funeral.
well, you disappeared on us, but, well, me and john, we just wanna say that...
arthur, shut up.
all right.
all right, talk to me.
we got to angel at the hospital where he laid. cut his throat.
he's dead.
cleared out the rest of the italians out of the south of the city.
they mostly went to the black country, but we told betty kitchins to keep her moving.
and betty sends her condolences.
what about the old man?
we interrogated his boys.
yeah, he went to liverpool.
he's waiting for an immigrant ship to new york.
when?
berthed ship sails saturday.
all right, i have contacts, people in cunard and liverpool.
they'll have passenger lists.
they can get you into the point of departure.
you pick him up, and you bring him to me.
who's he got travelling with him?
- his wife.
- what?
his wife.
so shoot her, and bring him to me.
uh, tommy, mrs changretta was a teacher at our school.
she's a good woman, tom, a good woman.
well, if she's a good woman, then she'll go to heaven, eh, arthur? just do what's on the list, nothing else. then burn it.
don't speak on the phones. the fucking secret service is listening.
i want the old man alive. i wanna do it myself.
that's it.  you can go.
come, john.
tommy, if you haven't got a bird here, you're gonna have to tell us something.
ask polly.
not michael?
what?
- not michael, no?
- no.
not michael, no. 'cause michael deals with legitimate business.
you saw him before us.
john, not now.
wait, what did you say?
you saw michael before us!
fuck's sake, john.
because legitimate business, john, is the priority.
- legitimate business...
- since when?
since my fucking wife took a bullet meant for me.
oh, yeah. ok.
yeah, so secret service. secret fucking service...
blah, blah, blah. but you don't tell us shit.
we're a couple of fucking toy soldiers.
"do this, john. do that, john. kill your fucking teacher, john!"
this is how it's gonna be.
all right, listen to me. there's gonna be a little war in a little place that no one gives a fuck about.
and the side that is gonna lose needs a little bit of help.
and they're willing to pay.
when that business is done, legitimate business is the priority.
now, do what's on the list and fuck off.
when are you coming back, hmm?
i'm back, arthur.
- john, you're just as young.
- cheers.
the thing is, we all naturally came in here, where the servants eat.
it's nothing to do with politics, ada.
it's fucking freezing in the big room.
john, mind your language in front of carl.
ada, we're in the servants' quarters because it's where the fucking booze is kept.
- arthur, find better words!
- yes.
pol, does swearing in gypsy count?
that's no reason for us to be speaking shelta in any case.
i'm just saying there is no need.
when she's drunk, my wife can't speak fucking english.
john!
- fucking right!
you dealt with it?
incentives, no threats.
implied consequences without specific reference to physical harm.
that's why young michael is the boss.
he knows better words, right, pol?
since when was i your boss, arthur?
first, the boss meets you. then the workers meet you.
when did either of you two do a day's work?
in the old days, finn, family meetings used to be all of us together.
arthur, shut up.
now, me and john, we're just fucking bin men whose duty it is to obey.
hmm?
mrs changretta.
arthur, shut up. finn, go and get us cigars.
so what are we gonna do all night, eh? climb fucking trees?
john, stop swearing in front of the kids.
yeah, and who said you're staying the night?
i know what we can do.
we get the guns out, john.
we go outside, and we shoot some fucking pheasants.
- that's what the bosses do, isn't it?
- yeah.
fuck off, arthur.
fuck you just say to me?
i didn't ask for separate meetings today, all right?
no. no, what the fuck did you just say?
'cause i didn't fucking hear you right.
i didn't ask for separate meetings today, all right?
fucking pheasant.
carl!
you can't say things like that.
now look what you've done.
all right, brothers.
it's just the fucking whisky talking.
i don't ask to be protected, all right?
right. shut up. the pair of you, sit down!
sit down!
- yeah, yeah, yeah.
- look around you.
and look at this house.
look where we are.
look how far we've come.
i think it's about time we all started acting in a way more appropriate to our station.
we're none of us bin men any more, arthur.
tommy needs us all together.
i'd like to propose a toast.
it's a family united that shall never be defeated.
tommy's gone. swear to god, he's in a wagon with johnny dogs.
shit.
this is what he does now.
- tommy! wait!
- arthur!
- tommy!
- arthur, let him go!
- tommy! tommy!
- tommy! tommy!
tommy!
walk on. walk on.
- tommy.
- walk on.
they're coming out in the drive.
- you're not gonna tell them?
- tell them what?
that we're going to wales.
i left a note.
did you tell them why we're going to wales?
no.
at some point you're gonna tell me why we're going to wales?
yeah, when we get there.
walk on.
should have brought at least one woman, tommy.
johnny, it's a woman we're going to see.
- there, boy. walk on. walk on.
- right.
says he'll be back in birmingham in three days.
let him go.
the important thing is, if he says he'll be back, he'll be back.
come on. let's go light a fire in the big room.
let's go drink whisky, with water.
see to the horses, johnny.
aye, tom.
so we'll go out through meridian, then into the black mountains.
here.
here, give me some.
boy.
here you go.
now, remember last night when you asked after mama?
she's gone, charlie, and there's a few things we need to get straight.
there's her photographs.
there's her clothes.
i'll keep things the way they are in the room. just keep things the way they are.
here you go.
yeah. here you go.
i'm not much good, charlie.
you'll find that out soon enough.
she's not gonna be coming back, so it's just you and me.
she'll be with us in our hearts 'cause we love her.
- tommy.
- yeah.
this fucking horse of yours won't come to me.
- all right, i'll be there. all right.
- huh? come on.
that was her favourite horse, charlie, and he's been all over the place since she's gone.
- tom?
- yeah, you watch him.
i will. oh, yeah.
huh?
all right, now cock it with your thumb.
there you go. now she's been cocked.
she's alive in your hand.
it's like waking up a girl when you cock that trigger.
she rolls over all sleepy-eyed and she goes,
"michael. michael."
"what are you gonna make me do, michael?"
you boys are fucking crazy men.
- yeah, but you feel it, though, right?
- yeah.
you feel it.
yeah, you can feel the power.
now, squeeze it.
powerful.
- fucking useless.
- piss off, john.
michael, why does a pen pusher who sits on his arse all day wanna fire a gun?
hmm? eh?
cock it again.
- cock it again.
- cock it again.
round two.
mmm.
look at that fucking face, john boy.
look at that face.
now he feels it.
but you won't feel nothing until you point that thing on a man.
so do it.
there you go, young boss.
there you go. now you feel it.
now you feel what we feel.
this is what it's like.
michael, that's a webley.
jumps on the hammer.
how does it feel, michael, huh?
better than having a pen in your hand, isn't it?
more like having your cock in your hand. yeah.
yeah, it is.
one squeeze.
i'm gone.
i'm fucking meat.
michael, you fucking watch that webley don't jump. you know that?
when you pull that fucking trigger, and the body of the man you shot wraps itself around your ankles, they pile up.
it gets to the point where you can't walk in a room without bringing a load of them with you.
what's going on?
what's going on?
polly, we're just educating the boss here one our side of the business.
michael, get in the house.
i'm not a fucking kid any more.
you've come to tell me it's cancelled.
no, why would it be?
i read the papers.
- this is business.
- it won't work.
i told your brother, this whole fucking plan won't work.
if tommy wants to keep this secret... tell him.
there was a woman in a fur coat walking through here in broad daylight like the queen of fucking sheba asking about armoured cars.
during a period of grieving, some things were allowed to slip.
we know the woman. we're dealing with it.
now, take a look at this list.
these are all the men who work the night shift who are members of the south birmingham communist party.
you've got six weeks. sack them all.
are you fucking mad?
he is.
yeah.
every factory in the city will come out on strike.
so? you find reasons.
you set them up.
you sack them.
look at the list again.
are there any communists on your shift who aren't on the list?
no.
please don't fucking lie to us.
- who's missing?
- i don't know.
emmanuel hunter.
hmm?
convener, deputy treasurer, sparkhill communist party.
lathe operator to you.
i didn't know he was a communist.
we left that name off the list on purpose.
see if you could be trusted.
you can't be trusted.
look, i'm just a working man.
we're gonna be watching you.
- watching your fucking house.
- i've got kids.
ethan and john.
just get them sacked as they appear on the list, two a week.
the last one before the clocks go forward.
is that a yes or a no?
- yes.
- thank you.
good.
good.
- do you think he'll return?
- tommy?
he'll always come back.
you speak differently when you talk...
i prefer to talk about other things.
let me see.
what books do you like?
riding, flower arranging, embroidery?
you'd be surprised of the things i know.
you'd also be surprised of the things i don't know.
what could you possibly not know?
i wasn't educated.
- at all.
- what is there to learn, after all?
goodness.
i'm sorry. you must need a rest.
do you tell your friends you're painting a gangster?
is that the fun in all of this?
in truth, i don't have any friends.
i knew everyone through my wife.
when she died...
well...
look, polly, my motivation for doing this is twofold.
firstly, you have a face full of contradictions, and it's a challenge to capture them in one expression.
that's the sales pitch.
the second motivation is that i am planning to seduce you eventually and, please god, sleep with you.
how would that please god?
please me.
and stop.
and he didn't say what he wants.
when he was drunk, he said absolution.
other than that, nothing.
thank you for your time, madame boswell.
i heard someone shot your wife.
if you're looking for soldiers, our men are all up at appleby.
i have no need for soldiers.
it's not why i came here.
what do you think?
you're selling?
giving.
- why?
- would you take it?
i'd take it.
would you wear it?
- why would i not?
- that's my question.
my wife was wearing it the night she was shot, and i lie awake at night at 4:00 in the fucking morning, and i blame myself for her death.
i pushed some people too far.
you want me to tell you this jewel is cursed, and then her death won't be all your fault.
if i believed in the priests,
i would confess and ask for forgiveness, but all i have is you, madame boswell.
i have a son.
i have a business.
i need to get some sleep.
it is cursed.
i feel its curse burning through my heart.
bless you, tommy shelby.
you'll have good fortune from now on.
- the business is done?
- it's done.
you're not going to give me one fucking clue what that was about?
all religion is a foolish answer to a foolish question.
what does that mean?
go and get charlie from the camp.
he'll have learned enough bad habits by now.
you can drop us to the train station.
and johnny boy, if i were you,
i'd come back here tonight later on.
it's gonna be one hell of a big fucking party.
the day and date on your ticket.
if you can't read, find someone who can.
tickets for sailings other than today's will be destroyed.
he has people all over the docks.
if it's going to happen, it will happen now.
we'll be all right.
why don't these irish fill in their papers in advance?
think about mott street, the café, the smell of the coffee.
police! help! police!
officer, there are some men, they mean us harm.
we are in danger here. can you escort us to the dock?
please.
come with me.
excuse me, brother. you got a light?
thank you, officer.
- that'll be all.
- john shelby.
is that the lad i used to teach? john shelby, i smacked your arse.
let him go.
- please. please, let her go.
- arthur?
how many times i looked the other way because of your sweet smile.
i said, let him go. he's coming with us.
not until i know my wife is safe.
she's safe. we're not going to harm her.
let's just get a move on.
look, we're disobeying tommy's orders just by talking to you.
don't push it, please.
- come with us. let him go.
- let him go, too.
say it's done.
say he's in the harbour. he can do you no harm from new york.
i can't do that, mrs changretta. i can't do that. sorry.
ok, ok. audrey, listen.
- no!
- listen to me!
go to the café in mott street. bonito will take care of you.
let him go, too. he's an old man.
i gave you sweets and cakes.
mrs changretta, there are rules.
your husband knows the rules.
- come on, old man.
- no.
sorry.
we're disobeying orders here.
let him fucking go!
you have 10 seconds, or tommy's orders stand.
they stand. one!
- two!
- please!
three.
- i love you forever.
- four.
- no, no, no!
- america. a new life.
no, no, no!
a new love.
do you know what time it is, old man?
i'll tell you.
it's after seven in the evening, and i'm going to keep you alive until it gets light.
i'll not deliver the final cut until we can both hear the blackbirds singing outside.
it's a beautiful sound, which my wife will never hear again.
now, i'm gonna have to choose carefully which part of you i cut away first.
open your eyes.
open your eyes, or i will cut away your fucking eyelids!
now look at me.
look at me.
this is the end.
this is the end.
it was your tongue that gave the order.
i'll take your tongue first.
then i'll take your ears.
then i'll take your fingers.
then your fucking toes.
see, i take your balls first, you drain too fast like you fuckers do.
no, i think tongue first. tongue first.
tongue first.
if i take your tongue, you won't be able to explain, and i want you to explain. i want you to fucking explain.
come on, tommy.
i forget who i am.
i forget who i am.
i'm a blinder. i'll take your fucking eyes first!
i heard the blackbird sing.
and we let his wife board the immigrant ship to new york.
we didn't kill mrs changretta.
and tonight...
we're not those kind of men.
you get rid of the body, john.
get rid of those for good.
all gone.
oh!
did you do what was on your list, ada?
you and your fucking lists.
did you?
i spoke to an old friend of freddie's.
he's a communist party candidate for basall heath.
i asked him about the birmingham branch of the national vigilance committee.
he said he'd heard the soviet embassy was getting information from the inside.
and? has he got a name?
yes.
but just promise me no one will get killed.
ada, it'll be me or john or arthur who gets killed if you don't give me the fucking name.
there's someone ahead of us, and i need to know why.
james monkland.
he's a lloyds underwriter. he's got an office on curzon street.
tommy, for fuck's sake, who is it that's ahead of you?
i knew i could count on you, ada.
no, you can't, and i just asked you a fucking question.
and i notice you started wearing lipstick again.
so what?
i got bored.
you can change what you do, but you can't change what you want.
and what is it that i want?
there's gonna be a vacancy coming up at shelby company limited.
boston office.
boston, america?
lipstick. clothes from paris.
no revolvers. all legal.
just turn a few heads. do the transit deals.
james monkland, right?
good night, ada.
- james monkland?
- yours, sir.
who the hell are you?
what do you want with me?
you've been passing information about a robbery at the lanchester factory in sparkbrook.
are you tommy shelby?
i need to know the name of the person in the organisation that was giving you information.
what organisation?
the economic league, the vigilance committee, the odd fellows, section d.
they have many fucking names.
shit, shit, shit.
give me the name of the informant.
mr shelby, they are very, very dangerous people.
oh. hmm.
well, fortunately, so are we.
you have to choose who you're more afraid of.
the peaky blinders at exactly 11:43, or section d at some point in the future.
if you make the wrong choice, you won't see 11:44.
do they always have to do the stock taking at night, arthur?
only 'cause, you know, it slows down production.
thank you.
thank you.
night work will have to end.
it will. it will.
you'll have things to do at night.
yeah.
i know.
we've spoken about it.
i was gonna wait until you had a strong cup of tea in your hand.
- come on, then.
- but i'm gonna have a baby, arthur.
pregnant?
yeah.
you said you spent the night taking stock. well, so did i.
this working at night will have to stop.
- you'll have a baby.
- yes.
oh, it's great news.
right, then.
let's have a cup of tea. one moment.
come on. let's have that tea.
arthur, for fuck's sake, what is it?
no. we wait for tommy.
i've got a stolen statue back there with its dick hanging out waiting to be melted down.
tell us. tell tommy later.
yeah, look, he's not here. he's not here. i'm going.
- hold your horses.
- there he is.
- bye, curly.
- there he is.
all right, what is it?
arthur's fucking giving us all this shit.
come on. come on.
right.
arthur, you got wire on the fucking cork. give it here.
bastard. right. gentlemen!
linda is up the swanny. i'm gonna be a fucking dad.
fuck off.
yes, curly. yeah.
arthur, i knew you had it in you.
i knew he had it in him.
september she reckons.
her tits feel different already.
yeah, that's not the only thing that's gonna be different, brother.
you're fucked now, man.
fucked. absolutely fucked.
oh, nothing's gonna change, john.
goodbye, arthur.
- i have a meeting i have to go to.
- yeah.
yeah, of course you do.
yeah, you...
you go to, mate.
congratulations.
- i'm gonna be a dad.
- proud of you.
your highness, mr thomas shelby.
welcome, mr shelby.
i believe you've met everyone apart from my wife,
grand duchess izabella petrovna.
please, take a seat.
before we begin, mr shelby, we must offer you our sincere condolences on your recent loss, which some of us witnessed.
- did you drive, mr shelby?
- yes.
- they say you're an expert on cars.
- yes, i am.
i am curious. what was your father's profession?
well, he told fortunes, and he stole horses.
often, he would tell a man that his horse would be stolen, and they would marvel at his powers when it was.
before we eat, should we say grace?
for what we are about to receive, may the lord make us truly thankful.
- amen.
- i'm not here to eat.
i'm here to do business.
what i have to say can be said before the main course.
then i will leave you all to your evening.
grand duchess, i must apologise for the bad manners of my compatriot.
this is a report on the mission's progress so far.
i've made only one copy for security.
who should i give it to?
my husband is in charge of this operation.
but since there will no doubt be vodka later, perhaps you should give it to me for safe-keeping.
speak, mr shelby, while we eat.
five factory foremen on our payroll have begun a campaign of victimisation against communist workers in five factories across birmingham.
anger amongst the workers will grow, but we will control it.
on the night of june 21st, a general strike will be called across the city.
protests will develop into riots, and all police that are not already under our control will be busy.
the city will be paralysed.
so how will you move the train?
we have two locomotive drivers who've been allocated to drive the midnight goods train to london.
the armoured vehicles will be waiting on flatbeds.
- and ammunition?
- the ammunition...
i have to say that this soup is exceptional.
absolutely delicious.
ammunition, incendiaries will already have been packed up and crated for transport to istanbul.
- and how long to london?
- the train won't reach london.
all the goods will be unloaded at a coal yard at st albans and put onto shelby company trucks.
from there, they will go directly to the poplar docks.
you highness, if you're having difficulty understanding his accent, then i can go through the plan with you at a later date.
if there is no ship waiting for my men, all goods will be dumped into the sea before first light.
what happens when they discover the armoured cars are missing?
during the rioting, the lanchester factory will be firebombed.
a scrap metal dealer of my acquaintance will declare that all the armoured vehicles are in the wreckage and should be written off as salvage.
no one will know that they are in your possession.
we formulated this plan when we met at birmingham.
i'm certain that nothing has been overlooked.
this is the amount of extra expense i believe i will incur for trucks and fuels.
i trust you will respond in kind.
but of course, mr shelby.
before i go,
i would like it known that i'm unable to swallow food in the same room as this priest.
enjoy your evening.
tatiana, see mr shelby to his car.
yes.
walk with me.
the priest is passing information about the robbery to a lloyds underwriter called monkland.
he, in turn, is passing information to the soviet embassy.
you want him dead? i'll kill him, no charge.
why would the priest pass information to our enemies?
i'm being paid to act and to observe, like a soldier.
the complexities are your business.
go and speak to izabella. i trust her to decide.
you were able to contain your business dealings even after what happened.
perhaps you didn't love her.
she's here by my side, and she says, "don't trust these people."
now give me permission to kill the priest.
<i>remember last night when you asked after mama?</i>
<i>do they always have to do the stock taking at night, arthur?</i>
i'm gonna have a baby.
what business do you have with the russians, tommy?
<i>i've been to the factories</i>
<i>and the armoured vehicles are in good condition.</i>
"a factory break-in," that's what you said.
when you go home today, be sure to check under your little boy's pillow.
<i>we can reach anyone.</i>
<i>anywhere.</i>
<i>the priest is passing information about the robbery</i>
<i>to a lloyds underwriter called monkland.</i>
why would the priest pass information to our enemies?
<i>the complexities are your business.</i>
now give me permission to kill the priest.
watch out, john-boy, he has got a strong left.
arthur, john, finn. come here.
all right, what is it?
this letter says that dad's dead.
he was in boston in a bar called the mickey free.
two men waiting in an alley. he was shot twice.
who's rosie rice?
some fucking whore.
she is a woman who took the trouble to write to us.
and she wanted us to know that during the night, while he was dying, he asked for our forgiveness.
the only thing he ever taught us was how to kill and cut a stag.
- finn, john, you won't remember.
- i remember. cannock chase.
parked up at a pub called the griffin.
he got drunk and sang <i>silver dagger</i> about 100 times.
yeah. one weekend.
one weekend he was like that.
the stag is to remember him.
we eat and then we forget him.
no need to forgive him. agreed?
john, i have to say this.
you can name your new baby after him if you like.
no.
arthur, i won't even ask.
so his name dies.
it's been in the family for a long time, but now it's gone.
all right, that's done. fuck him.
before we cook and eat, there's some business.
boys!
i wanted to say this out here, 'cause i don't trust the maids in the house.
there's gonna be a robbery.
- i wish to confess.
- there's no confessional today.
the name's shelby.
bless me, father, for i have sinned.
today is a holy day.
look, i came. i made myself.
have you been drinking?
i couldn't sleep.
i tried to get enough down me to get myself to sleep, but...
i just do these night vigils by myself, thinking...
how long since your last confession?
i don't remember.
mrs shelby, do you have something to confess?
do you know it is actually "gray"? my name is elizabeth gray.
yeah. do you think god calls me pol or polly?
the voice calls me pol.
you hear a voice?
- yeah. like bernadette heard a voice.
- and what does the voice say?
"murderer."
it says this to you?
it's in my head. who else would it be talking to?
and are you a murderer?
if you're talking about the law, then...
yes.
- i'll be out in a moment, peter.
- yes, father.
are you saying you want to confess to a murder?
no.
my confession is that i feel no regret.
he was a policeman. he was a bad man. he hurt me.
i do the things i do so that my son doesn't have to do them.
it's just the wiping away of the shit from under your feet.
the taking of any human life is a mortal sin.
no, the unjust taking of a human life is a mortal sin.
look it up. look who did it.
moses, samson, lord kitchener.
are you saying you took the life of a policeman?
oh, father.
now there is another life to be taken.
if there is a voice telling you to take a life, you must ignore it.
the voice doesn't tell me. the voice asks me.
it says, "pol,
"does this way of excusing a murder still work
"if the life that is going to be taken is a consecrated man?"
he's a man of the cloth.
he's a holy man.
what kind of holy man?
it's not fair.
they're off drinking and shooting rifles as we sit here.
listen to the mugs swearing, spitting on the bloody floor for us to fucking wipe up!
without men here, they'd be like dogs pissing up the wall.
i was just saying it's not fair.
the men are down there like lords.
esme, just...
get on with it.
i'm bloody five months gone.
- i forgot the combination. - 24-8-22.
how do you know the paper cash combination?
- tommy talks in his sleep.
- shut up, esme.
he's changed the combination.
- you've put it in wrong.
- no, i haven't.
your hands are shaking.
and actually, i am sleeping with tommy, ok? now and then.
because he wants to, now and then. when the mood takes him.
except we don't sleep.
it's hard to sleep bent over a desk, isn't it?
happy?
none of it's fucking fair.
it's two hours' work.
bit of grease on your cuffs, and that's it.
tommy, should i really be here for this?
i've cleared it with polly.
there's no way around it. we need you to know.
who the fuck wants to buy 27 stolen armoured cars?
a foolish man.
and how much is this foolish man paying?
£150,000. cash, diamonds and sapphires.
so that's 20 for you, charlie.
isiah, there's 5 to you.
the rest we take to america to invest in legally-acquired property.
assets bought with untraceable income resold, and the profits reinvested to make sure it's clean.
and after that, i suppose, the whole business will be like that stag hanging up over there, right, tom?
well, with profits on this scale, we'll be in a position to stop the off-track business for good.
keep the pubs, stop the protection.
horses for the sport and race days for a lark.
i made a promise to charles' mother.
now, i also made a promise to linda.
i know.
i can see it in your eyes, man.
part of the reason for doing this last job is so you'll be set up when you do decide to walk away.
look at you, arthur.
a man that wants to live a clean life, but here you are signing up for the biggest robbery of all.
i have to hand it to you, tom.
- you're a smart man.
- you in or out, charlie?
curly?
shouldn't have killed the stag, tommy.
- oh, shut up. shut up.
- bad luck.
how do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds when we're done?
we don't.
but that's another business.
right, let's cook some meat.
can't wait to part with their money, stupid bastards.
it's all right, it's me.
arthur said you'd be short-staffed today because they are on a works outing.
piss-up, actually.
i brought sandwiches and the lemonade i made myself.
i'll make tea and empty ashtrays, but i won't handle money or slips.
arthur says what you do here is illegal, but not immoral.
depends what time you get here, linda.
and anyway,
i thought i'd offer you my physical and spiritual support in your time of need.
oh, linda, if you want to be a help, run up to the shops and get me 20 senior service.
- lizzie'll give you the change.
- no, i won't.
actually, i'll use my own money, polly.
and before you ladies decide to find me so amusing, i have a message for you.
oh, god, no, linda.
i've been to church already. have you?
it's not a message from god, polly.
- it's from jessie eden.
- who's jessie eden?
she's the lady shop steward at the lucas factory in sparkhill.
lady shop steward?
she's bringing all the female workers in the spot-welding and wire-cutting shops out on strike for the day.
in protest at being made to work on a holy day.
poor conditions, lack of holidays, unsanitary lavatory provisions and lower pay for female workers.
apparently, all the female factory workers in the city are joining the protest in sympathy and will walk out of their places of work at 9 a.m. to march on the bull ring.
all oppressed female workers welcome.
them bastards down there shooting deer.
me five months gone, sat here like a pudding.
only one outside lavatory between the lot of us.
not consulted.
bent over a fucking desk.
ladies, i honestly believe those who march on good friday will have god on their side.
it's 9 o'clock, ladies!
open the fucking door!
fuck it.
i'm not in the mood today.
let's go to the bull ring.
hallelujah!
the foolish man?
not quite.
i'm sorry i came unannounced.
what do you want?
we need proof.
proof of what?
you said the priest is a traitor.
we need to know how you know.
the proof is my word.
if he is involved, i'm out. he needs to die.
are you always so violent?
i killed a stag today, and it hurt me to do it.
but i treated it with respect, and the spare meat will go to poor people.
it will grieve me far less to put a bullet in the priest's face.
will you not sit when a duchess sits?
i'm told you're part of the deal. is that true?
the royal court in tbilisi actually worked very efficiently.
ah, i see. and it worked like this, eh?
there were lots of corridors and small rooms.
attics.
there were no rules there. deals were done.
brothers gave sisters, aunts gave uncles, fathers gave daughters and servants.
it was my aunt's idea that i came alone.
she is in charge of this.
when there are no rules, women take charge.
they understand that the power they have comes through silent agreements.
i've promised i will do everything i can to make this plan work.
my aunt assumed you would want me as part of the deal.
i will tell her she's wrong.
tommy, you ain't gonna believe this, man.
i just phoned the garrison, right? i just spoke to billy.
he says polly, esme and lizzie have gone on fucking strike.
- they what?
- they've gone on fucking strike!
half of birmingham is out.
the female half, they're all out, every single one of them.
quakers put 'em up to it.
who's watching the shop?
polly's locked it up.
see, good friday's one of our best days for takings.
all the men get drunk. the races are all fixed.
it's like picking apples off the lowest branches.
hey, john?
hmm, yes.
then your business is very easy.
- was linda with them?
- you know,
billy said that polly jumped in the fucking bull ring, just pissed out of her mind, started going on about revolution, screaming to the rooftops.
was linda with them?
yeah.
then it was linda's idea.
linda's a smart woman.
john.
there's a bentley in the drive outside.
i want you to go out and put a nail in its tyre.
it's good friday, so there'll be no garages open.
the lady will have to spend the night.
then i want you and the boys to all go home.
you take charlie, put him with arthur and linda for the night.
they can use the practise.
- you want to put a nail...
- yeah.
- you heard me.
- yeah.
right. nice to meet you.
why do you need to put a nail in the tyre?
i want it so neither of us can change our minds.
we came back early.
polly didn't finish the count yesterday.
hmm.
so you thought you could take a tenner.
i thought i'd finish the count.
hey!
esme, i've told you. stay off the snow till the baby's born.
it does no harm, passes the time.
- knocks down the walls.
- listen.
listen.
i know you miss the travelling.
it's all gonna be all right.
it's like being a hen in a coop.
remember that house in lichfield?
the one the bailiff used to throw you out of?
throw you in the ditch.
i'm gonna buy that fucking house.
big as tommy's with more land.
if you feel cooped up, we'll take a wagon, camp out by the ditch.
how?
it's all gonna change, esme.
this is not your bedroom.
this is not where you slept with your wife.
do you ride horses?
no.
i would need to open my legs in a public place and that is not allowed.
you drink whisky?
no.
it tastes like men. i prefer wine.
cars?
no.
so, diamonds are your only love, eh?
sapphires?
they're just a currency.
well, you know, if it was me who had all them jewels,
i think i'd just sit with them, look at them, touch them.
izabella does that sometimes.
late at night.
i swear she puts one of the biggest sapphires into her body for pleasure, and walks up the stairs to breakfast with it still in place.
- and it stays in there all day?
- yeah.
oh.
what is your weakness?
talking about duchesses with sapphires inside of them.
mmm.
i think i already know your weakness.
i can get a fuck whenever i want, love.
yes.
but i am a duchess.
and i am under you like a horse.
i'm like a telegram.
"a telegram"? i don't think your english is so good.
or maybe you should listen more carefully to what i have to say.
hmm?
i have a message for you, mr shelby.
as a duchess, i can show you what is possible for a man like you.
a man in a house like this.
right now, you hide inside it like a boy who's broken in through the window.
why did we come to a bedroom for this? hmm?
in your own house?
that's a loaded fucking weapon.
we could fuck by the fire with the maids standing to attention and watching.
what can they do?
- give it here.
- nothing.
there are no rules for you. hmm?
give me the fucking gun.
you have maids here. you can bring a maid into the room.
what can i do about that? nothing.
- give me the fucking gun, now.
- you have power.
everyone does what you tell them to do.
your brothers, your soldiers, no one can stop you.
don't point the fucking weapon at me.
i can be an actress.
who do you want me to be?
your dead wife?
now, that's enough. give me the fucking gun!
if you don't like something, you say stop, and it stops. hmm?
but you are afraid of it.
you break the law, but you obey the rules. why?
did you know that madness sets you free?
otherwise, we're just peasants obeying the law.
there is madness inside your head, too. i can see that.
let a duchess show you something.
i emptied the chamber, except for one bullet.
- no! no, please.
- this is a game we used to play.
no.
- watch.
- do not fucking do this.
no. look at me.
don't do this.
no!
give me the fucking thing.
it brings you alive. you won't try it?
no, i do not want to try!
and i do not want your mad fucking russian brains all over me fucking walls.
i survive each time by the will of god.
get to fucking bed, now!
i already called a maid.
fucking...
you see?
you are afraid.
like a boy who's broken in through the window.
i need to educate you in how to run a house like this.
yes. come down.
pour us a drink.
mary, go back to bed, please.
you go back to bed, please. this woman is drunk.
that's all right, sir. should i pour whisky?
- yes, he will have whisky...
- no, go back to bed.
he will have whisky and i will have wine!
mary, go back to bed.
- in a house like this...
- stop talking.
- the servants expect it.
- go back to bed! do as i say!
normally, if there's a call after midnight, the maid who comes in is the one in love with the master,
- but she is not in love with you.
- this is not fucking russia!
please, mary. go back to bed, hey?
i know your weakness, tommy.
it's freedom.
madness.
killing.
i am the first one who understands you.
i found her perfume.
put it on.
what proof do you have that the priest is a spy?
i told you. i gave you my word.
then kill him.
from now on, you must do everything that you want to do.
there'll be two of us for breakfast this morning, mary.
she's gone for a walk by the river.
the lady left, sir.
left? how?
she took your car.
she what?
she was in a terrible hurry. she said she had your permission.
she told david to go to the garage to get a new tyre for the bentley.
she said you could use that.
and why the hell would you listen to her, eh?
the way she said it, sir.
- how was she, tom?
- talkative, yeah.
hmm.
i was fucking working, all right?
yeah.
from what she said, when she was out of her fucking mind,
i'm pretty certain the treasury is underneath the house.
what have you got?
our ada got this from the british library using her scholar's pass.
she talks about her aunt coming up the stairs to have her breakfast in the morning, which means it has to be in the building somewhere.
wine cellar. septic.
kitchen cellar.
and a tunnel under the river.
they don't trust a soul in this country, so my guess is they've turned one of the cellars into a strong room.
did you find someone, arthur?
moss gave me this.
stefan radischevsky.
he's a kid from greet, lives in cheltenham.
dad's a russian. he has dreams of owning a pub but he's got a record.
- breaking and entering.
- hmm.
- and he speaks russian?
- yeah.
their butler drinks in a pub called the masons arms.
get to him, tell him who we are, offer him some money if he gives the kid a job in the house.
wait.
talk to the kid, offer him one of the pubs we took off the italians if he works in the house for four weeks, keeps his ears open.
all right?
come.
the executive committee of the union of bookies and allied trades will see you now, sir.
i heard you were giving speeches off the back of a wagon, pol.
i can't remember a fucking thing.
well, moss tells me you were threatening to burn down the town hall.
oh, tommy, we were having a laugh.
you know, actually, the crowd around me was bigger than the crowd around jessie eden.
who's jessie eden?
she's too soft.
you're not gonna break the capitalist system talking about separate lavatories for women.
who is jessie eden?
she's our new best friend.
shop steward at the lucas factory.
a woman shop steward, i've heard of her.
there is a leaflet here if you want to take a look, tommy.
so, a separate lavatory? is that it? is that what you want?
i don't know what you want.
you have to tell me what it is that you want and then i'll know.
actually, we want to know about the robbery you're planning.
not the factory robbery. the other one.
the one you're not telling the women about.
- john has a big mouth.
- no.
arthur's got a big mouth. arthur told linda, linda told me.
- polly?
- read the leaflet, tommy.
ladies, why don't i talk to tommy privately, and then i'll report back to you faithfully.
you're not just gonna take payment from the russians, are you, tommy?
you're going to clean them out, is that right?
- esme?
- so...
what happens after, when they come for us?
when i'm about to give birth?
get out, get back to work.
esme, come on.
- keep us posted, won't you, sister?
- i will.
fucking hell.
so arthur tells linda everything, eh?
she's stolen his soul and taken it to a better place.
the suburbs.
where men are honest with their wives.
we can trust lizzie.
yeah, but i can't trust esme.
i can't trust the fucking russians to pay me or the army, and i can't trust my own brother to keep his fucking mouth shut.
did you make progress last night?
yes.
john said the girl looks like edna purviance from the pictures.
be careful.
she's an excellent source of information regarding the location of the merchandise.
- here we go.
- you know, there is a general lack of discipline in this fucking company.
she stayed the night.
i'm working, pol.
i am working for the good of the company.
you're grieving.
and when you grieve, you make bad choices.
i know. i did it myself.
look. no more marches.
no more fucking politics.
it can kill us. all right? joke or no joke.
did you tell arthur about the priest?
i only told you.
thanks for the burden.
you were correct not to talk over the phone.
what did she say?
she said there was gonna be a killing. a holy man.
and she was with the shelbys, was she?
i suppose you have something to say about yesterday.
no.
it's something else, actually.
i believe arthur has told you about some business we're planning, linda.
oh, there's always business, thomas.
and arthur believes when this business is done, it'll all be over.
arthur believes you, but i don't.
linda, the people who have hired us to rob the factory are very bad people.
they'll not pay us, as they've promised.
so, on the night of the robbery, we will take what is ours from their treasury.
and a bit more on top for luck.
if you're saying you're gonna stop arthur,
i need to know.
that'll be arthur's decision.
and your plan is still to reform him, eh?
- to the absolute degree of redemption.
- mmm-hmm.
well, arthur will walk away from this with £30,000. we made a deal.
and afterwards, you and arthur can begin your new life.
did you say 30,000?
arthur said the estimated total proceeds would be 150,000.
- estimated. yes.
- a third of 150 is 50.
- why a third?
- the three brothers.
- finn is not yet a man.
- there are expenses.
of 25,000, you said.
as of last night, the expenses increased.
we need to dig a hole.
arthur agreed to a plan with a figure of 25.
25 from 150 is 125.
a third of that is £41,000.
sugar?
yes.
thank you.
so, you've worked this all out, i see?
only in my head. i haven't written it down.
linda, are you saying...
if it were 41,000".
i've already told you, that'll be arthur's decision.
but i don't imagine he'll accept less than 41.
- may i smoke?
- no.
so, i imagine you have some plans for your 41,000.
yes. california.
for the child's health, away from the smoke.
we want to run a general store on an indian mission.
the americans invite quakers to do good work with the indians.
we've already sent our papers and been accepted.
arthur shelby as a missionary...
- no. arthur will run the store.
- hmm.
i will teach in the school next to it.
arthur will swim in the ocean. i will be on the beach with a towel.
the open air and the sun will get rid of all the nonsense in his head from france.
that's some plan.
as you know yourself, the arrival of a new life concentrates the mind on practical things.
amen to that.
when is the child due?
september.
when is the robbery?
june.
then the timing's perfect.
we'll book a passage through the panama canal the day after the 41,000 is paid to arthur.
did we agree 41,000, linda?
i heard nothing to the contrary.
- word association. right now.
- oh, god. i hate this game.
it's freud. it's terribly fashionable.
i'd rather you put on that music that i hate.
are we going mad in here, do you think?
yes.
we shouldn't have drunk red wine with the cake.
and i believe your vow never to sleep with another man is a good one.
good for the painting.
it's not a vow. it's just...
i think when men want sex, they become hilarious.
like a dog, when you pick up a lead, and he knows he's going for a walk.
may i respectfully point out that so far you haven't even picked up the bloody lead.
there.
that's the look.
imperious.
no man is good enough.
you idiot. you nearly killed him.
i told you we needed him fully conscious.
we need to stop using soldiers who've been in india, they hit too hard.
not fucking hard enough.
hey, mr shelby. hey.
i heard about your plan to kill a holy man from a voice in the confessional.
can you hear us?
grace?
shelby.
why were you attempting to kill father hughes?
maybe we should wait until he is fully conscious.
i have a dinner appointment.
hey, shelby?
wake up. eyes front.
mr shelby, you were trying to kill me, were you?
passing information...
fuck. he knows.
where am i?
you are among the odd fellows. please count from 10 to one.
ah, fuck you.
whatever else you might have forgotten about last night, remember this.
i am passing on information to the soviet embassy on the instruction of section d.
it's part of a bigger picture.
you explain to the russians that you were mistaken about me, and you apologise to me in front of them.
a threat on your sister was evidently not enough.
you do as we say, or we will take your son.
hear this. we will take your son.
we can do it at any moment.
we have people in your life.
you will make your apology to me tomorrow night, and you will repair the damage you've done.
or you will never see your son again.
sir, i don't understand...
i don't understand why, as a former soldier yourself, you have sacked all of the former soldiers on the staff.
it means there is only one man left in the household.
mary, i want it so that charles is never left on his own.
understood?
sir, i should call a doctor.
there will be some men coming down from birmingham.
and you put them up here in the house.
you put them in the front and back of the house, you feed them, and you...
why are they needed, sir?
i brought a cursed sapphire into this house, mary.
and now, i'm paying for it.
and i don't know what to expect.
but neither do my enemies.
tell david to bring the car around. i'm going to go to london.
- sir...
- and get me some tea, mary.
yes, sir.
<i>hello?</i>
- yes, arthur. <i>- tommy?</i>
they want the robbery to be sabotaged.
they don't give a fuck who gets hurt.
<i>are you ok, tommy?</i>
- it's a bigger picture now. <i>- what...</i>
did john make a list?
<i>speak clearer, tom.</i>
i said did john make a list?
<i>john-boy! john!</i>
right.
<i>gypsies and kin only. yeah.</i>
good.
<i>tommy, can i ask you why?</i>
<i>tommy?</i>
no, karl. i told you. go on and play in there.
hello?
ada, it's me. it's tommy.
ada, i need you to...
i need you to speak to one of your comrades and get me a meeting with someone from the soviet embassy.
tonight.
your place, 10 p.m.
it seems that mr shelby was given bad information by an informant who was also in contact with the underwriter, who, as we know, is in the pocket of the soviets.
- wine, tatiana?
- a little.
bad girl.
sorry i'm late. i, uh...
there was a body on the line.
drink, mr shelby?
no, thank you.
it was drink that caused half this trouble.
i have come here to apologise.
i have already explained that you now realise that your absurd allegation against me was false.
indeed.
and that your base nature made you rash.
and that now, once again, our plan is back on track.
when a child in my care commits a sin, first of all, he confesses, as you just did.
and then, i instruct him to perform penance in a manner of my choosing.
as a child, you went to church?
yes.
do you remember the act of contrition?
good.
do you remember the words of the act of contrition?
yes.
as your penance, i would like you to recite it now, in the presence of our associates.
go away.
uh...
oh, my god, i am heartily sorry for having...
instead of "god," say my name.
since it was me you offended with your false allegation.
father hughes, i am heartily sorry for having offended you, because of your just punishment, but most of all, because they offend you.
father hughes, who art all good and deserving of my love,
i firmly resolve to...
with the help of your grace, to sin no more and to avoid all near occasions of sin.
mmm.
very good. thank you.
amen.
and now that we are a united band once more, perhaps we could order some food.
i'm sorry. i am not feeling well. i have to go. good night.
mr shelby...
my god, tommy.
- are they here?
- yeah.
- do you have cocaine?
- no.
tommy.
tommy, this is the special adviser to the soviet consul.
members of the british establishment and exiled white russians are planning to rob armoured cars from a factory in birmingham.
we know about the robbery. we have an informant.
no, your informant is working for them. they want you to know about the robbery.
your informant is working to their instruction.
why would they want us to know?
they want you to...
they want you to stop the robbery.
they want you to commit a violent act on british soil.
tommy, do you want water?
a violent act on british...
to force the british government to break off diplomatic relations.
that's the game.
the robbery in birmingham is just the bait.
why are you telling us this?
because my family are the ones who will be sacrificed if you decide to blow up the train.
the consul wants to know who you are.
he's tommy shelby.
you can take his word.
- ada.
- tommy...
ada.
ok.
stop, stop.
ada, stop.
ok.
drive me to a hospital, ada.
if i'm not conscious when i get there, tell them i have a fractured skull, concussion and internal bleeding.
i think i may have haemorrhaged.
- tommy.
- ada, go on.
- be quick because i can't see.
- ok.
i can't fucking see.
ok.ok.
except for you, dad.
i can see you.
<i>where do you keep these things? bank?</i>
we have our own treasury.
<i>wine cellar.</i>
and a tunnel under the river.
my guess is they've turned one of their cellars into a strong room.
did you find someone, arthur?
stefan radischevsky.
- and he speaks russian?
- yeah.
he works in the house for four weeks and keeps his ears open. all right?
i have a bright future too.
mapped out.
but you wanna try things first.
<i>- michael...</i>
<i>why does a pen pusher who sits on his arse all day</i>
<i>want to fire a gun?</i>
there is going to be a vacancy in shelby company, limited.
no revolvers. all legal.
<i>get me a meeting with someone from the soviet embassy...</i>
he was in the war.
he was in a tunnel collapse.
he won medals...
<i>take care of him...</i>
here he is, mr shelby.
thank you, nurse.
tommy.
i need to speak to you about the priest.
- i know things about him.
- hmm.
from when i was a... from when i was a boy.
i will shoot him myself, tommy.
just teach me how to shoot.
it's easy, michael.
just point and pull the trigger.
he asked for me today, mary.
not his mother.
for the first time...
he missed you...
where is he? is he in the kitchen?
yes, he's with the girls and johnny.
oh.
did you remember your medicine, sir?
did you ever read the bible, mary?
sometimes.
do you ever read it out loud while standing naked next to my bed?
'cause when i take the morphine the doctor gave me, that's what you do.
i'm wide awake, but you are standing there naked, plain as day, reading from the book of leviticus.
do you want to know what happens next?
no.
neither do i.
that's why i poured the medicine away.
go and get johnny, mary.
that's it.
without the firing pins, the guns won't work.
and there are no replacements?
they don't make these any more. these are the end of the line.
yeah, we had the foreman take out all the spares.
if we take the pins, they'll never fire a shot.
and nobody will know until they unload the bloody things in tbilisi.
or until they are facing our guns at kutaisi.
take them all out and give them to me.
oh, come on, boys, no fucking about.
and i will tell the soviet ambassador that there is no longer a need to blow up the train.
and i'll tell tommy you accept his plan.
you know, some mornings i wake up,
i think i've died and this is heaven, tom.
i mean, the wives and kids camped out by the valley, huh?
and not being moved on.
sure, me, meself, i'm surrounded by maids and food and booze.
see that line, there?
no.
it's the edge of heaven.
the border between birmingham and paradise.
and today, my friend, you are going to step over that line, back into the world.
you mean, you have something for me to do, tom.
have you ever heard of hampton court palace, johnny?
no. i can't say i have.
you and three families of the lees are going to set up camp
100 yards from the gate of the palace.
you won't be moved on because i have just bought the land.
you will be joined by some old friends of mine, who are going to open a hole underneath your tents and caravans.
you see this blow to the head you took, tom...
and for allowing for the hole to be dug, you will get £5,000, which you will split between the three lee families.
i take a lot of this money is to do with not asking questions, tommy?
dead right, johnny.
and when the hole is filled in again, you can go back to paradise.
mr shelby, your brothers are here.
and there is someone who described himself as "the wandering jew".
will you take the jewish gentleman to the drawing room and take my brothers to the kitchen and give them tea and rum?
yes, sir.
good morning, mr solomons.
yeah, it is.
nice little place you've got here, thomas.
what is it?
a foreclosure of the gambling debt from some poor, young lord who you pumped full of opium in one of your casinos, or is that just tittle tattle?
drink?
nah, i don't touch it, mate.
your housekeeper said you're not allowed to drink.
eh?
she said you are suffering from so many ancient injuries from your sporting life that your head is like some sort of smashed vase what has been stuck back together by a horse.
now.
word in london is that you can be found wandering the streets of birmingham, stark naked, throwing away money.
you talk to dead people.
also that you believe that you are powerful enough to summon up jews of a very particular standing, up to the gentile wilderness wherein you live and order for them to do your fucking bidding, mate.
yet, still you came.
yeah, well, you know... i was passing, weren't i?
do you know something, alfie?
this morning, i tried to read the paper and i realised that the only consequence of my terrible accident is that i now need glasses.
right...
all right, well.
i know a man who can make you a pair of these.
now, he's a magician, mate.
he's a magician.
so not only will you be able to read your newspaper but you will also be able to see into the future.
now i know this, right, because he made this pair here for me.
so you don't have to worry about telling me what this is all about because i have already seen it.
you're fucking about with the russians, ain't you, you silly boy?
you've got two choices, michael.
you fuck off to america with arthur and join the apaches, or you marry the girl.
this isn't a joke.
arthur, are you really going to live with the apaches?
- has she told her father yet?
- no.
he'll fucking shoot you, man.
are you sure the kid is yours?
i wish i hadn't told you.
then think of marriage as a beautiful road...
flowers all the way down it.
- is he joking?
- it's hard to tell these days.
do you, er...
do you love the woman?
fucking what?
well, then go and marry her like the rest of us.
she doesn't want her family to know.
and she doesn't want to have the baby.
we know a woman.
- shut up, john.
- same woman who helped you out, twice.
- they weren't my women.
- mmm-hmm.
that's why you had them fixed, arthur.
charlotte will want the best...
- she is the best. - "the best."
used to be a nurse. twenty minutes. done.
and you don't have to go to in or wait outside.
you go to the garrison.
drink whisky. have a laugh.
remember, john?
and then this kid walks in, no shoes on, says, "it's done".
second time we was in there.
same kid, this time he is wearing shiny new shoes.
- and he shouts, "it's done, arthur."
- and what?
she bought new shoes with the money i gave her.
it was for a good cause.
arthur?
if you are going to get on like this with the apaches, they'd fucking scalp you, boy.
tommy said when that bell rings we've to all go to the big room.
come on. tommy has a plan.
arthur.
- arthur.
- arthur, come here.
shalom.
arthur, shalom.
- alfie.
- shalom...
come here. come on. listen...
i owe you a little something, don't i?
i do. come on.
sit down.
come on, sit down here.
there you go.
right.
listen.
arthur.
i want you to know, right, that whatever happened between us, yeah? back then...
that was business.
it was just business. all right?
and i also want you to know that i have made my apologies via my own god for abusing a very holy day to get you clinked up and battered, which i did.
and, now, i would also like to extend my personal apologies unto you.
all right?
i hear that you have allowed jesus to come into your life.
eh...
oh, you heard then.
yeah. that is beautiful. that is wonderful.
that is lovely, isn't it?
that is lovely.
but i was wondering, how does that work for you on a day-to-day considering your line of work, mate?
your apology's accepted.
'cause i hear you're a right fucking nuisance with it.
hello...
listen, all i am saying is that, every man, he craves certainty.
he craves the certainty, even if that certainty of yours, right...
well, i mean...
it's fucking fanciful mate, innit?
eh?
i'm old testament.
fucking hell. look at that. now, that...
that scares me more...
yeah.
congratulations, tommy.
you now have the finished article right here, don't you?
see, that man, right? he will murder and maim for you with god on his side.
yeah.
you don't want to let him go.
if we're gonna do business with this fucker,
i demand to know why.
right...
while i was in the hospital,
i formulated a plan.
and this is how it is going to work.
so the russians cannot be trusted to pay us.
we are going to take what is ours.
we need to see what's in their treasury.
and that is why we need mr solomons.
right, boys, just remember they are fucking insane...
and dangerous...
and drunk on stuff we've never heard of.
and they're worse than us for spirits and ghosts.
and, today, they're going to test us.
fuck them.
the russians all turned and ran.
the cossacks didn't run, arthur.
mr shelby. welcome.
how is my car?
i think i am in love with it.
and i yours.
so we should keep what we love, yes?
excuse the reception, whenever we open the treasury, the cossacks are on guard...
<i>in russia, men on the other side of the law</i>
<i>decorate their body in tattoos.</i>
- nice.
- right...
now, some of these tattoos are proof of allegiance to underground organisations, which are the sworn enemies of the royal household.
so it is customary in russian royal households to check for such tattoos before engaging a man in business.
and as we approach the allotted day these ladies here would like to make sure that you are not assassins or infiltrators, so...
no, we're all good.
so they'd like to check your skin.
they want to check our skin?
yeah.
now my body has already been checked, although, at the time, i wasn't sure that was the reason.
and now it's your turn.
well then, boys.
take your clothes off.
fuck off.
no. no. no. no. no...
obey.
obey, arthur.
no, i won't be obeying nobody. get out of my way.
arthur. come here...
eh?
come on, arthur.
shut up, john.
i will have a maid gather the buttons and sew them back on.
hmm.
all right. fuck it.
there you go, ladies.
made in fucking birmingham.
all right, i think we've seen enough, eh?
tatiana.
your face, arthur, is a fucking picture.
sometimes assassins hide their allegiances behind their balls.
you pass the test, soldier.
with flying colours.
you see?
he wants to be a good man.
but there, now.
there.
inside every man there is a devil...
the real diamonds, eh?
it is traditional to seal the successful examination with vodka and music...
holy fuck, tom. what was that?
well done, boys. eh?
well done, arthur.
now you know what you have to do next.
all right?
one last job.
make contact and play nice.
give me five minutes.
i brought michael because, as chief accountant, he has to be witness.
ada, can i use your phone?
michael.
business first.
michael, stop looking at your watch.
ada, whilst you are reading this, can i go and use your phone?
who's the lucky girl, michael?
her name is charlotte and michael cannot breathe if he does not talk to her every two hours...
ada, please...
phone's in the hall. dial nought for the line.
thank you.
and keep it quick, i pay the bill.
i will.
not for long.
think about it, pol.
together, we can take control.
with two of us in the company, we can straighten things out.
what about the politics?
you and me, fighting together and winning, that is politics.
that is a new kind of politics.
it's just this way, i get paid and karl gets a nice christmas.
good.
welcome to the bourgeoisie.
my name is smith.
my girlfriend is pregnant.
and, er...
we'd like you to help us.
we need to fix a date...
welcome to shelby company, limited.
shelby company, limited.
limited and unarmed.
michael, would you like to welcome ada, our new head of property and acquisitions.
congratulations.
where do i sign?
ada, have you got, erm, whisky?
yeah, tommy.
i've already told him.
he's becoming too like his cousin.
i thought that was the idea.
yeah, tommy but with a bit more fucking charm and class.
yeah.
that'll help.
yep.
where am i sleeping, ada?
- michael...
- in the room next to karl's...
michael...
good night!
oh, heartbroken, poor love.
so how shall we celebrate?
well, with michael in bed, i thought i might, erm, go for a little drive.
drive? where are you going to drive?
polly?
things have begun to develop with the man who is painting my portrait.
polly?
it's when you stand there in the dress, you just find yourself talking about every little thing.
and have you...
- no.
- hmm?
not yet.
but he called me two nights ago to say that the portrait was finished and i said i'd go there in the morning.
but he said no. he wanted me there tonight.
ada, you don't breathe a fucking word of this to the boys...
- okay, but is he nice to you?
- no, no. i mean it, ada.
is he rich?
his friends write the papers, ada.
tommy would try and close him down.
so go.
he's like a tiny bird pecking at you.
and i think he's given up on me.
so bloody go.
why should the boys have all the fun?
more vodka.
wait there.
you're doing good, stefan.
it's a fucking madhouse.
yeah, i know.
the prince wants me to suck his cock.
and how much do you need to say yes?
that's on top of the day rate for the arse slaps.
when am i out of here?
soon.
so what you got?
the strong room is not guarded at night, but they said they will kill the three brothers in the <i>"uglya dvor".</i>
coal yard.
the duke was talking about using a sword but the woman, she was talking about using machine guns.
it's a fucking madhouse, john.
we're doing up your pub in nechells.
it looks a treat.
keep your fucking head up, peaky boy, eh?
fucking madhouse, man.
we are almost there.
this way.
this treasury was built 200 years ago to protect the king’s jewels in case of french invasion.
we are now underneath the river thames.
your jeweller.
i don't think they trust me, tommy.
mr solomons is the only jeweller i trust in london.
yes. "trust". yes.
might have to add that on the old invoice.
thank you. thank you.
as we agreed, your jeweller will now select items to a total value of £70,000.
when you have selected your chosen items, they will be put into a box and stored.
when you have fulfilled your part of the deal, the box will be delivered to you.
may i just start, right, by saying that i may choose to stay here and just starve to death and choke on sapphires and never go back to the fucking world again.
yeah, well, there is a good reason for that, you know, little man.
because my shop, all right, is just above a rum house.
- so...
- you speak russian?
i do, yeah. i do.
'cause of me mum.
yeah, my mother.
you people, all right?
you hunted my mum with dogs through the snow.
yeah.
but today, right, is for forgiveness, innit?
for selection.
so... now... hello!
right, i think it is fair to say, yeah, £1,500?
fifteen hundred.
mmm, yeah, i will give you £1,800.
i know the current market value. eighteen it is.
that's very gracious of you.
right then. how about... let's have a look at this.
this is a nice little bit you got there, innit?
oh, but that was a gift from tsar nicholas.
i ain't asking you though, am i? i ain't asking you.
all right. i come here to do business, offer my professional services.
if you keep interrupting me, i won't be able to focus.
do you understand?
mr romanov, let me remind you we were told to come here and choose what we like and now we have chosen.
tsar nicholas gave you that. i will give you four.
five, with the royal provenance.
done.
all right, rumplestiltskin, let's go over here and have a look what's in these boxes.
two...
that is much nicer, 10.
and that there, that was definitely a five.
- you keeping schtum?
- yes, i am.
yeah, another five.
- seven!
- six...
let's call it six, eh?
beauty. look at that.
- beautiful, isn't it?
- that is splendid.
- splendid, yes.
- beautiful. is it not?
- it is.
- it is a work of art.
- you recognise this work, do you?
- immediately.
i'm guessing, right, that all the bad ideas around here, they're you.
right, they are you, aren't they, hmm?
how do you mean?
yeah. er, tommy, see this, right?
it's got paste in it. that's paste.
let me tell you something, son.
somebody comes into my shop with some paste like this...
usually, what i make them do, right...
is fucking swallow it.
eh? what game are you playing?
- eh?
- mr solomons...
shall we, er...
- shall we clean it up?
- be careful.
eh?
hmm?
yeah.
yeah. right, what have we got?
thirty seven thousand, six hundred.
mmm.
oh, well...
do you have any eggs? excuse me.
i am simply asking...
fabergé is not part of the deal.
we would not offer you fabergé eggs...
my jeweller here, he advises me to insist on fabergé.
it's a deal-breaker, tommy.
oh...
i brought that from crimea myself.
fucking hell...
with the provenance of that being laid by such a delicate beauty, that does indeed bring us the entire selection to £70,000.
here.
good man.
and now, mr shelby, you will join your brothers and mr solomons will take his leave.
i demand absolute honesty.
- oh, sorry, can i?
- i insist.
there.
a woman of style and substance.
i am a student of silence. is this a good silence or a bad silence?
it's good.
it's good.
- it's very good.
- no. it's still wet.
i know it isn't saying much in the grand scheme of things but this is the best work i've ever done.
i'll miss sundays.
there will be more sundays.
sorry.
sorry, can you not do that, please?
- can you just not do that, please?
- i am sorry. i am sorry. i am sorry.
- it's all right. it's...
- i am sorry.
vodka!
i sewed your buttons back on.
i wanted to see if i did a good job.
yeah, you did.
you did a good job.
sir?
no, i didn't.
my aunt only employs the best whores.
how did you feel when i held him?
you were jealous.
you wanted to kill me.
or him. no?
why do you play games with people when there is no benefit to you?
in russia, because we were bored.
in england, because we don't know how to stop.
at least they are silly games and orgasms.
so let's fuck.
- here?
- no.
oh... in a darker place.
you still love her, don't you?
you want her?
why would you fucking say that?
- why would you fucking say it?
- tommy...
- you love her.
- what are you fucking saying?
you want her? you want her?
who the fuck are you, eh?
huh?
what are you fucking saying?
you want her? tonight?
watch...
in the palace in tbilisi, there was a priest.
and he would put his hands here.
and with that strangulation, there was also ecstasy.
it's called khlysty. a siberian prayer.
you're almost hungover.
- you are almost dead.
- but in that moment...
women who had lost men in the war would lay down and they would fuck the ghost.
you want her?
you want her, don't you?
you want her!
now, you should drink this.
- it's holy water.
- get the fuck away from me.
there.
i opened up another treasury for you.
you should call this painting...
<i>fuck them all.</i>
1 will.
the parish...
the king.
the copper.
yeah, the copper in particular.
do you want to hear the wildest story of them all?
yes.
i killed a policeman. in cold blood.
with a gun.
really?
she did it.
i tell you what.
i tell you what, i swear at one point...
at one point, i looked down at the top of her head and i thought she was going to pull me cock off in her hand and fucking throw it out of the window.
oh, she sucked me dry, i swear to god.
like fucking spud water at the end...
we've had worse nights...
you're quiet, arthur, eh?
yeah, yeah, yeah.
- fuck off.
- how was your night, brother?
- you got all your buttons back, eh?
- yeah, all right.
yeah, what's god going to say about it, arthur, eh?
fuck off, both of ya.
he tells linda everything.
every single thing.
yeah, well, we'll see...
we're going to miss you when you're gone now, arthur.
just drive the fucking car.
private letso reporting for duty, sergeant major.
at ease, private.
good to see you.
seven left. out of 50.
should i get them tea?
get 'em beer.
they used to run on it like cars on petrol.
give them the black country stuff.
it's in the barrel with the tack.
they're going to fucking clean me out.
whatever they take, they'll put back.
good men.
john, arthur.
you remember these boys.
well, if it ain't the tipton fucking clay kickers, eh?
- clay kickers.
- come here, you.
- how are ya? good to see ya.
- how are ya?
- nice.
- good to see ya.
and this is william letso.
from the south african native labour corps.
sent to flanders from the bloemfontein diamond mines.
and the best tunneller i ever met.
so, there's three cellars underneath the house.
wine, kitchen and septic.
there's a tunnel here that runs from the house underneath the river to an underground strong room.
now, this used to be the palace treasury.
the tunnel runs directly west and it's separated from the house by three iron doors with locks we can't open.
we need our tunnel to run from here and hit the strong room, direct.
primrose hill 23. ada thorne.
ada?
is michael still there?
right, would you tell him that i have taken the car?
he can take the train.
and try and find out why he's been so bloody sour lately.
you shouldn't go looking through other people's private things.
he's my son.
the bullet was mine. i never got a chance to fire it.
and the gypsy rules say it must be passed on...
it's not about rules, pol.
it's about he asked me.
it's about he told me why he wanted to do it.
now, if i tell you,
i can't take the knowledge back.
better off without it.
so this is when he was with the parish...
better off without it, pol.
this is when he was with the fathers.
this is when he was in the care of the holy fathers.
michael wants it so you don't know...
- that priest...
- that priest who was there when he was taken in.
and who is still walking the fucking earth.
fuck...
fuck...
he asked me, pol...
and i said yes.
and i said,
"you put a bullet in that fucker's brains.
"by order of the peaky blinders."
no.
not my son.
he'll still be as dead if arthur does it.
and part of him will always stay dead.
- i swear to god...
- in whose house it took place...
if my son pulls the trigger,
i will bring this whole fucking organisation down around your ears.
<i>"a factory break-in," that's what you said.</i>
we should never have got into this, tom.
on the night of june 21st, a general strike will be called across the city.
how do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds when we're done?
we don't. but that's another business.
when this business is done, it will all be over.
and afterwards, you and arthur can begin your new life.
so there are three cellars underneath the house.
there's a tunnel here that runs from the house, underneath the river, to an underground strong room.
we need our tunnel to run from here and hit the strong room, direct.
i need to speak to you about the priest.
<i>i will shoot him myself, tommy.</i>
i swear to god, if my son pulls the trigger,
i will bring this whole organisation down around your ears.
welcome to the opening of the grace shelby institute for non-insured children of the poor.
i would very much like you to join me in thanking the man that made the founding of this establishment actually possible.
ladies and gentlemen,
mr thomas shelby.
speech!
come on, speech!
aw!
say it, tom. say it to 'em!
erm, i didn't come here today to make a speech, but i will say this.
these children are now safe.
in our care, they will be safe.
because we are from the same cold streets as they are.
and in our care, they won't be shipped away to the colonies, or separated from kin, or made to work for men in their various ways.
they will grow up here, at home... loved... in birmingham.
because this is our city.
by order of the peaky blinders.
hail!
now let us sing <i>immortal, invisible.</i>
you hear that, grace?
the absence of my invitation for this event was obviously an oversight on your part, mr shelby.
look, i have the keys. i have allocated myself an office.
just there, two doors in from the street, it's the one that already has the stove and the crucifixion on the window.
mr shelby?
it is the one that has the crucifixion on the window in orange and red, that will be my office.
and i will take them to saint aloysius for confession.
you do understand these keys are part of our broader arrangement?
in the next 24 hours, you will do exactly as you have been instructed.
you will not deviate, you'll not fail.
come on, little fellas.
ow!
the, uh...
the lord mayor would like you to come and eat cake and drink some tea.
tommy says, "mingle and smile."
it must be the trains.
no ruben?
do you know any other guests from london who have not turned up?
some, i think. yes.
pol, i'm paid by the company now, so i have to talk to other people.
so you have moved from horses to automobiles in just four years?
when you ship to new york you pay a higher dock duty.
you should consider coming with us through boston.
i just spoke to johnny dogs. he said the tunnel's hit heavy clay.
- it's slowing him down.
- how long?
two days before they hit the wall.
tell him to dig a sinkhole to drain the clay.
he's asked if you could go down and have a look yourself, tom.
i told him, wild horses wouldn't get you down.
- hmm.
- yes.
mr shelby, i'd just like to say that i wish i had met your dear wife before she was taken from us.
and i would like to allocate an hour a day of each of my lady's time to make winter clothes for the little ones.
speak to my secretary, ms stark, in the grey hat. she knows my diary.
fuck me, tom. i don't know how you do it.
incoming.
- mr shelby?
- yes?
aw. your little boy looks so much like you.
he does, yes. he's a little rascal, isn't he?
mr shelby, would it be too inconvenient to steal you for a moment?
no, no. no inconvenience at all.
tommy, i am sorry. he wants you.
- aw, come here, charlie.
- there's daddy.
oh, little boy.
so lovely to see a man willing to hold his child in public.
from the members of
- the moseley war widow's institute.
- ooh, watch this!
made by mr winslow himself of winslow castings.
look at that!
from a photograph of your horse that ran at the derby.
oh, that is very kind.
- thank you very much.
- grace's secret.
charlie.
would you mind holding it for us so that we can have a photograph for the gazette?
hey, hey, hey.
oh, thank you. thank you. thank you very much.
thank you very much.
thank you, mr shelby.
- not at all.
- thank you.
thank you for your time, ladies.
thank you. thank you for your time. thank you. thank you.
where's charles, ada?
i gave him to you.
- where is he?
- i don't know.
boys.
- have you seen charlie?
- eh?
- i haven't seen him.
- i don't know.
he is playing, ain't he?
pol, where's charles?
lizzie, where is charlie?
- i don't know.
- where is he?
back door. kitchen.
get to blake street, where the cars are.
tommy! someone said they saw a nurse take him through the back door.
- fuck.
- what nurse?
i don't know. go.
- arthur.
- what?
somebody said they saw a woman and a kid getting into a car.
ah, fuck!
charlie!
charlie!
charlie!
john.
- where is he?
- john.
- arthur.
- go find moss.
- arthur, where is he? where is he?
- junctions, block them all off.
- tell me.
- someone took him.
all right.
hey, listen to me! they put him in a car.
they put him in a car and drove south.
we've got roadblocks and spotters.
i'll set up shop and put every man we have
- on the junctions from here to maypole.
- yeah. yeah. right. you do that.
- but you have got to go to the office.
- yeah.
you've got to sit by the phone.
- whoever took him is going to call.
- right. of course.
polly!
let's go, pol.
stay by that phone. me and john will cover the roads.
i need michael at the maypole junction.
i need moss to block all the roads south.
give me moss. gone where?
- tommy...
- it's them.
- who?
- it's fucking them.
look, it might just be some random woman.
- because sometimes women go mad...
- no, it is them.
did you break the phone?
he broke the phone.
it's all right, we have got another phone.
- tommy?
- ada?
there's someone outside, a priest.
stay here, pol, stay here. don't do anything.
we have your son. get in the car.
first.
is he safe?
of course he's safe.
all children are dear to me.
you have all the cards.
tell me what you want me to do and i will certainly do it.
you ever drive one of these beasts?
i am asking you to conduct business.
of course, i borrowed it.
lent it by a lord for the duration of this business.
i will certainly do what you need me to do with no complaint.
we were forced into doing this awful thing.
we did warn you that your son would be in danger if you deviated from the plan.
it was you who made a mistake.
- you understand?
- yes.
what mistake did you make? do you even know?
tell me what you want me to do.
- you made a deal with our enemies.
- i will do what needs to be done.
you went behind our backs to stop the soviets from blowing up the train.
but it's all right. it's all right.
we've rectified your mistake.
you ask me, "what do i need to do?"
well, here is what you need to do, you fucking mongrel, you...
since the bolsheviks will not be blowing up the train, you will blow up the train yourself.
it has always been about the explosion from the beginning. the bang. the outrage.
understand?
those are notes and fragments for you to scatter in the wreckage, implicating named officials from the soviet embassy.
i will scatter them. it will be done.
good.
our friends at <i>the times</i> and the <i>daily mail</i> will do the rest.
and once the british government cuts diplomatic relations with the soviet union, that will be our mission accomplished.
you would have been part of a fine adventure.
to help with the outrage, we need people to die in the explosion.
how many?
let's say... six.
rail workers, perhaps, men from the factory.
and i want my son returned to me within an hour of the explosion.
oh, it's conditions now, is it?
we need to fix the handover in advance.
i haven't finished with you yet, mr shelby.
we also hear that you are digging a tunnel.
mining for precious stones under wilderness house.
i'm told they have a fabergé in the strong room.
the lilies of the valley egg made in 1898.
one of the odd fellows has a wife who's obsessed with fabergé.
he wants to give her the egg for her birthday.
then he will have it.
and the economic league will take all of the jewels that you steal, to cover our considerable expenses.
the fight against communism is not cheap you know.
- so if you want to see your...
- i will give you all the jewels.
a bang first.
then bring everything that you have stolen to your office at dawn.
no. no, i'm, uh...
i'll not be able to get the jewels to you by dawn.
the tunnel has hit clay.
if the st. andrew's clock strikes 5:00 a.m. on the night of the robbery and we don't have everything that we asked for, the bell will be tolling for your boy.
now get out of my fucking car.
- where's linda?
- with esme.
esme's water broke.
i was just with her. running around, fucking broke her water.
- where is finn?
- out with the young ones, looking for the riley. we couldn't reach him.
i need to know who spoke.
our enemies know everything. everything.
i need to know who spoke about business outside of the family.
i need to know who spoke and who they spoke to, now.
- tommy, listen, uh...
- your wife, arthur?
i am going to tell myself that you are not thinking straight.
your mind is not clear.
or esme getting cash for cocaine, eh, john?
fuck!
all of a sudden, back in the family, ada.
eh? that is a surprise. out of the blue.
on whose orders?
tommy, this is not helping find him.
and you and your painter.
you said he knows you.
things developed. you talked.
if anyone has talked about the tunnel to anyone else,
i need to know, and i need to know this second.
- what about your clay kickers?
- hmm.
drunk in a pub.
i'd trust those men with my life.
- more than you trust us?
- yes.
as of an hour ago, yes.
why is michael not in this fucking line-up, anyway?
- you leave michael out of this.
- oh, yes?
- no, he should be here.
- i fucking don't even know him.
and i have only fucking known him for fucking three years.
no, he is not going to be your whipping boy.
i don't even fucking know the boy.
i never told michael about the lilies of the valley.
the only people i told about the fabergé eggs are in this room.
tommy, i want you to know that i came back for love... and common sense.
and esme's got no need for extra cash.
and you bring my wife into this, means we speak when this business is done.
john, arthur,
i need 50 sticks of bsa dynamite and 300 yards of cable and six detonators by midday tomorrow.
and this is evidence. i need you to scatter it.
we're blowing up a train, and people are going to die.
ruben and i talked about many things.
but not that. not ever.
tommy, i'm sorry i'm late.
we looked everywhere, all the way up to hay mills.
we saw nothing.
put four cans of petrol in the boot of my car and bring it round.
put cigarettes and a lamp in the box.
and fetch michael. i need him.
ada told me he gave you red wine.
i imagine you can't remember half of what you talked about.
he was never interested in business.
he came to you at my wedding.
he pursued you. sought you out.
why would an educated man of his standing do something like that?
- you mean, to a woman like me?
- yes.
i've done the odds on all of you. even's it's him.
there is another possibility, but even's it's him.
bloody hell.
i asked that you come alone and unarmed.
yeah, well, alone i ain't never gonna do, am i?
and as for the cane, don't worry about it.
that is just my sciatica.
it always plays up around the winter and the summer solstice.
what have you got for me, alfie?
what did you bring me out here for?
this is on the way to somewhere i need to be in a hurry.
- mmm.
- what have you got for me?
well, seeing as you were prepared to pay such an exorbitant amount for this information, i decided to give you value for money.
so here are the names of all the men in england whom i would approach, right, if i had a fabergé egg for sale.
here you go.
and then, here's all the men on that list, you know, who would buy the old fabergé egg, even if they knew that that item was stolen.
here.
then comes your curious fucking gyppo question.
i won't ask but, erm...
here is a list of the men who would buy a fabergé because of their wife's obsession.
ah, yes. thank you, mr shelby. it's lovely doing business with you.
you left a name off the list, alfie.
- did i?
- yeah.
i've already spoken to my people in the jewellery quarter.
experienced dealers.
they tell me there are only three men in britain whose wives are obsessed with fabergé.
makes them good customers.
you missed the richest one off the list.
yeah, well, if you knew already how come you dragged me all the way out into the fucking oggin, mate?
two reasons. reason one.
by withholding a name that you most certainly know, you've proven to me that you have done a deal with the odd fellows.
it was you who told them about the tunnel.
you who told them about the fucking deal with the soviets.
reason two.
the name of the man that you're withholding must be my enemy otherwise, you wouldn't be protecting him.
he is now a man i can use.
listen, sweetie, you can't take a man...
you gave information in exchange for a share.
tommy... tommy there were things in that treasury, right, that god himself, he spoke to me, and he said, "alfie, you are meant to have these things."
you crossed the line, alfie.
- you fucking what?
- you crossed the line.
- "the line"?
- they are using my boy!
did you fucking know?
yeah, i knew, you know.
but damned as i am, it made no fucking difference to me, mate.
fucking hell, tommy!
oh! crying out loud.
what the fuck is going on?
what is the matter with you, tommy, eh?
eh? you've gone fucking angry, ain't you?
- yeah, i got fucking angry...
- it's in your fucking head, man.
- come on, man!
- this bastard deserves it!
he's nuts!
it's in your fucking head, son.
i know this bastard deserves it.
i fucking know.
but if you kill him now, the truce with the london outfits will be blown to fucking pieces, all right?
- michael. michael.
- don't worry about that truce, kid, right, because it fell apart.
you got nothing to worry about when it comes to the ol' scary london boys.
which fucking side are you on, alfie?
i do not give a fuck right now, kid. all right?
i do not want him to spare me because of some fucking peace pact.
i want him to acknowledge that his anger is un-fucking justified!
i want him to acknowledge that he who fights by the sword, he fucking dies by it, tommy.
so what, they took your boy did they, eh?
they have got your boy?
what fucking "line" am i supposed to have crossed?
how many fathers, right, how many sons, yeah, have you cut, killed, murdered fucking butchered, innocent and guilty?
you are going straight to fucking hell, ain't ya?
just like me!
you fucking stand there, you, judging me, stand there and talk to me about crossing some fucking line.
if you pull that trigger, right, you pull that trigger for a fucking honourable reason.
like an honourable man, not like some fucking civilian that does not understand the wicked way of our world, mate.
look, tommy, the killing of alfie solomons is not going to help.
this will be very bad for business.
michael, go and call inspector moss. tell him it's palmer.
well said, alfie.
well said.
i did not know about your boy, though.
i know.
i saw.
hello?
good lord.
polly...
why didn't you come?
i was going to get on the train last night but then i...
i realised i simply i wasn't ready to enter your world.
good god. i'm shaking.
good.
but now, i am ready. i have been searching all night for you.
polly, whatever you have been told, it is not true.
the painting was wrong.
she was too sure of herself... and i'm not.
not any more.
i can paint another.
oh, polly.
oh, polly.
what the fuck am i doing?
i want a dull life.
i want you. i want you. i want you.
i want you to paint me in a dress that i bought in a shop.
we have a life?
i think so.
hello?
i demand to see my solicitor.
i have a right to have him here.
gilbert palmer.
i want to talk to you about a missing kid.
we are peaky blinders.
where is he?
deep breath.
where is he? johnny! johnny!
what the fuck are you doing here, tommy?
they've taken my boy, johnny.
everything's fucking changed.
i have the hole dug before midnight or he's gone.
do you hear me?
are you not going after charles yourself?
tommy?
well, i was at...
this morning, i was out on the road with tommy.
i killed a man.
well, he needed cover. i was all he had.
so what did he give you?
he said it was good for close range.
you're better with my smith & wesson.
no, no. this is mine now. it feels part of my hand.
where'd you hit him?
i hit him in the side of the head.
how was you when he went down?
tommy said i did all right.
this is where we think charles is being held.
they're not expecting anybody, so he should be alone.
there is two good men there.
you do what they say.
but i fire the bullet. all right?
yes, you can be there.
but it's better if they do it.
see, these are experienced men, michael.
when you're sure the kid is safe, you call finn.
all right.
come on, boys.
hello there.
there you go. how's that?
like a spoon? a shiny spoon?
do you want to hold the spoon there?
all out, boys! wild cat strike!
this locomotive couples in 15 minutes.
if we don't hear word by 10:00, we blow it up.
there are men on board, arthur.
yeah. six men on board, charlie.
driver, stoker and four men i hand-picked myself.
me and john picked those men.
so it is me and john who will pull the switch.
the rest of you men can go home.
tommy. tommy.
he has got the shakes, help me with him.
get him out. get him out.
we are bringing him through.
we need to move. now.
you wait here.
i'll do the killing.
that is a fucking order.
you move too fast, thomas.
we need more timber.
make it safe. i will go on.
thomas, it is too fucking wet. it's sludge.
make it fucking safe, and i'll go on!
okay.
what do you think you are doing, boy?
please don't.
please don't shoot. please don't shoot.
please don't. please.
you fucking rat!
what do you think you're doing?
you know who you're fuckin' messing with?
we don't have much time.
i'll take your fuckin' life from you.
let's go!
you are a gypsy bastard.
who wants to be in heaven, eh?
who want to be in heaven when you can be sending men to fucking hell.
hey.
i will do it, arthur. eh?
i'll do it.
i will take him.
no, this bastard is mine.
go call finn.
i told tommy i'd do it... so i'll do it.
arthur, wait!
charlie is safe.
it's all right.
- oh, god!
- oh!
let me speak to him.
hello, charlie?
hello, charlie.
can you hear me?
- yeah. <i>- yeah.</i>
yeah, you go to bed.
good boy.
where the hell have you been?
i've been out in maypole.
there has been some trouble.
i can't stay.
you can't stay?
tommy needs my help.
it's family business.
- no, no. please.
- i am sorry.
please.
- where is he?
- he is upstairs.
mr shelby, this is <i>monsieur</i> silk.
he is here on behalf of the parisian buyers.
he needs to verify the value.
it was a pleasure doing business with you these past few months.
you would never steal from your family, would you?
the collection was mostly my mother's, anyway.
it is more mine than theirs, and they would never have sold it.
they would have wasted it on a lost cause.
you needed a tunnel.
i need your signature to make this sale legal.
confirmed.
the original duke alexander petrovich's collection.
to raise a legal bill of sale and get this across the border,
i will need an authorisation signed by yourself in the family name in my presence.
as we agreed.
half for the tunnel, half for the signature.
where will you go?
vienna.
there is a man waiting for me.
poor man.
you?
birmingham.
i'm going to buy a racehorse and have it trained.
also, £5,000 for the sex.
and five for helping you through the grief of losing your wife.
you didn't even come close.
the papers are in order.
now i just need your signature for the provenance.
of course. i have a pen.
at home, these jewels saw way worse.
that is why they are all cursed... as are we, mr shelby.
if you are ever in vienna, look me up.
yes, yes.
before i begin,
i want to let you know i made a mistake.
i made a mistake, and i want to apologise to all of you.
arthur, you warned me against getting involved in russian business, and you were right.
mmm.
i doubted your wife, for that, i am sorry.
linda, i have added 3,000 here, in the hope you will forgive me.
apology accepted.
esme, i doubted you as well.
now john has got innocent lives on his conscience.
- ordinary working men...
- yeah, all right.
- esme, we got it.
- no. she is right.
you and arthur are going to have to share that burden.
but i hope the house that you can buy with this can become a place of... contemplation and perhaps, redemption.
charlie, for lost tools and dangerous goods and curly's wise words.
johnny, for board and lodgings.
lizzie.
michael, for the killings.
five for cutting and five for shooting.
- no, tommy.
- what?
tell me, eh?
this is who i am!
and this is all i can give you for what you have given to me.
for your hearts and your souls.
yesterday, i nearly lost my son.
you should fucking understand that.
for what, eh? for what?
for this? for this?
and i know that you all want me to say that i will change, that this fucking business will change.
but i've learnt something these last few days.
those bastards. those bastards are worse than us.
politicians, fucking judges, lords and ladies.
they are worse than us.
and they will never admit us to their palaces no matter how legitimate we become.
because of who we are, because of who we fucking are because of where we are fucking from.
is that right, ada?
our ada knows.
she got smart about revolution.
and she knows you have to get what you want your own way.
lizzie, i want it known, that money was for you because some nights it was you who stopped my heart from breaking, no-one else.
and the rest of you, you took the king's shilling.
you took the king's fucking shilling.
when you take the king's shilling, the king expects you to kill.
right, arthur?
yeah.
that is how it works. right, john?
that's right.
that's right, pol.
that is fucking right.
tommy...
you've had a bad time.
we understand.
so at an alternative time, when we have all recovered...
i would like to put before the family an alternative view of the future of the shelby company limited.
a more hopeful view.
which i, for one, would quite like to hear.
as would i.
as would i.
come on, arthur.
the train for the dock leaves in one hour.
then we'll get the boat to new york, and it'll all be in the past.
i will be off then, tom.
i will see you, eh?
i will see you, brother.
bye, curly.
you can go, but you won't get far, arthur.
uh, all right, tom.
i spoke to moss last night.
he told me that the chief constable of birmingham has issued a warrant for your arrest.
murder, sedition, conspiracy to cause explosions.
john, they're coming for you as well.
murder, conspiracy to cause explosions.
michael...
- what the fuck? - ...for the murder of hughes.
polly...
wait a minute, what the fuck are you...
...the murder of chief inspector chester campbell.
why didn't you fucking tell us, tom?
the people we betrayed last night, they want to bring us down.
they control the police, they control the judges, the control the juries, they control the jails.
but they do not control...
- look what they did to us. - ...the elected government.
- why didn't you tell us before?
- you are my brother.
listen to me.
so i've made a deal.
- they will hang us!
- in return for giving evidence against them.
we will fucking hang.
it is all taken care of.
lizzie, collect up the money and bring it to the cellar.
you will all get your money in due course.
when the police gets in, do not resist.
you go with them, and you do not say anything.
arthur,
i have made a deal with people even more powerful than our enemies.
- arthur!
- trust me, brother, eh?
trust me.
- no, linda...
- you did this deliberately!
you made this happen to keep us!
come here. come here.
come on now, we have to run. we have to run.
fuck you!
